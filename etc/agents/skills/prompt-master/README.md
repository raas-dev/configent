<br/>

A Claude skill that writes the accurate prompts for any AI tool. Zero tokens or credits wasted. Full context and memory retention. No re-prompting your way to an answer you should have gotten on attempt one.

**Works with:** Claude, ChatGPT, Gemini, o1/o3, MiniMax, Cursor, Claude Code, GitHub Copilot, Windsurf, Bolt, v0, Lovable, Devin, Perplexity, Midjourney, DALL-E, Stable Diffusion, ComfyUI, Sora, Runway, ElevenLabs, Zapier, Make, and any AI tool you throw at it.

## 🚀 Installation

### RECOMMENDED - Claude.ai (browser)

1. Download this repo as a ZIP
2. Go to **claude.ai → Sidebar → Customize → Skills → Upload a Skill**


### OR Clone directly into Claude Code skills directory (Not Suggested)

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.claude/skills
git clone https://github.com/nidhinjs/prompt-master.git ~/.claude/skills/prompt-master
```

## 🔥 The Problem This Solves

Every AI user wastes credits the same way:

> Write vague prompt → get wrong output → re-prompt → get closer → re-prompt again → finally get what you wanted on attempt 4

That's 3 wasted API calls. Multiply by 50 prompts a day. That's real money and real time gone.

### The key insight

> "The best prompt is not the longest. It's the one where every word is load-bearing."

Most "prompt generators" make prompts longer. This skill makes them sharper.

---

## 🎯 Usage

In Claude, you can invoke the skill naturally:

```
Write me a prompt for Cursor to refactor my auth module
```

```
I need a prompt for Claude Code to build a REST API — ask me what you need to know
```

```
Here's a bad prompt I wrote for GPT-4o, fix it: [paste prompt]
```

```
Generate a Midjourney prompt for a cyberpunk city at night
```

```
I have a reference image — help me write a prompt to edit just the head angle
```

```
Break this prompt down and adapt it for Stable Diffusion
```

Or explicitly invoke it:

```
/prompt-master

I want to ask Claude Code to build a todo app with React and Supabase
```

---

## How It Works

Prompt Master runs a structured pipeline on every request:

1. **Detects the target tool** — figures out which AI system the prompt is for and routes silently to the right approach
2. **Extracts 9 dimensions of intent** — task, input, output, constraints, context, audience, memory, success criteria, examples
3. **Asks targeted clarifying questions** — max 3 questions if critical info is missing, never more
4. **Routes to the right framework** — picks and applies the correct prompt architecture automatically, never shown to the user
5. **Applies safe techniques only** — role assignment, few-shot examples, XML structure, grounding anchors, memory block as needed
6. **Runs a token efficiency audit** — strips every word that doesn't change the output
7. **Delivers the prompt** — one clean copyable block with a one-line strategy note

## Full Example #1: Generating Prompts for Images

### User Input
```
Write me a midjourney prompt for a realistic samurai standing in the rain at night
```

### Generated Prompt
```
lone samurai standing in heavy rain at night, traditional armor,
neon reflections on wet cobblestone street, cinematic lighting,
dramatic shadows, fog, ultra detailed, photorealistic,
shallow depth of field --ar 16:9 --v 6 --style raw

negative: blurry, low quality, watermark, cartoon, anime, extra limbs
```
**🎯 Target:** Midjourney · **⚡ Framework:** Visual Descriptor · **💰 Tokens:** Light (~60) · **💡 Strategy:** Comma-separated descriptors over prose, lighting and mood anchored early, aspect ratio and version locked, negative prompt prevents style drift.

---
## Full Example #2: Generating Prompts for Coding

### User Input
```
Build a claude code prompt for a landing page for a business
dashboard that looks and feels exactly like notion - smooth animations,
clean ui
```


### Generated Prompt
```
Objective:
Build a fully detailed, production-quality static landing page for a
business dashboard product. Design must match Notion's exact aesthetic —
clean, minimal, typographic, with smooth animations throughout.

Stack:
Single HTML file with embedded CSS and vanilla JS. No frameworks.
No external dependencies except Google Fonts (Inter).

Design Spec — match these exactly:
- Background: #ffffff
- Primary text: #1a1a1a
- Secondary text: #6b7280
- Border color: #e5e7eb
- Accent: #000000
- Font: Inter, weights 400 / 500 / 600 / 700
- Base spacing unit: 8px
- Border radius: 6px on cards, 4px on buttons
- Box shadows: 0 1px 3px rgba(0,0,0,0.08) only — no dramatic shadows
- Buttons: black fill, white text, no border radius above 6px

Sections to build in order:
1. Navbar — logo left, nav links center, "Get started free" CTA right.
   Sticky on scroll, adds subtle border-bottom on scroll with JS.
2. Hero — large left-aligned heading (max 3 lines), subtext, two CTAs
   (primary black + secondary outlined), hero screenshot mockup
   placeholder (gray rounded card, 16:9 ratio).
3. Logos bar — "Trusted by teams at..." with 5 placeholder company names
   in muted gray, centered.
4. Features — 3-column grid. Each card: icon (use emoji), bold title,
   2-line description. Hover state: border darkens to #d1d5db,
   translateY(-2px), transition 200ms ease.
5. How it works — alternating left/right layout, 3 steps. Number badge,
   heading, description, placeholder screenshot card.
6. Pricing — 2 tiers side by side. Free tier: outlined card. Pro tier:
   black background, white text, "Most popular" badge. List 4 features
   each with checkmarks.
7. CTA banner — full-width dark section, centered heading, subtext,
   single CTA button.
8. Footer — 4-column links, copyright line, minimal.

Animations — implement all of these:
- Fade-in + translateY(20px) to translateY(0) on scroll for every section,
  using IntersectionObserver. Threshold 0.15. Duration 500ms ease-out.
- Staggered animation on feature cards: 100ms delay between each card.
- Navbar CTA button: background transitions from black to #333 on hover,
  200ms ease.
- Hero CTA primary: same hover transition. Secondary: background goes from
  transparent to #f3f4f6 on hover.
- Smooth scroll on all anchor links.
- Navbar border-bottom fades in on scroll past 60px using JS scroll event.

Constraints:
- Single file only — all CSS and JS embedded, no external files
- No dependencies except Google Fonts via CDN link tag
- All placeholder images replaced with styled gray div elements
- Must be pixel-perfect at 375px mobile and 1440px desktop
- No CSS frameworks, no utility classes from external sources

Done When:
- All 8 sections render correctly at both breakpoints
- All animations trigger on scroll without layout shift
- Navbar sticks and border appears on scroll
- Hover states work on all interactive elements
- Opens in browser with zero console errors
```
**🎯 Target:** Claude Code · **💰 Tokens:** Medium (~380) · **💡 Strategy:** Every vague Notion aesthetic cue translated into exact hex values and pixel specs — Claude Code cannot guess wrong. Animations defined with exact timing, method, and trigger so there is no interpretation needed.

## 🛡️ 5 Safe Techniques, Applied When Needed

Prompt Master only uses techniques with reliable, bounded effects. Methods known to produce hallucinations or unpredictable output (Tree of Thought, Graph of Thought, Universal Self-Consistency, prompt chaining) are explicitly excluded.

| Technique | What It Does |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Role Assignment** | Assigns a specific expert identity to calibrate depth and vocabulary |
| **Few-Shot Examples** | Adds 2-5 examples when format consistency matters more than instructions |
| **XML Structural Tags** | Wraps sections in XML for Claude-based tools that parse it reliably |
| **Grounding Anchors** | Adds anti-hallucination rules for factual and citation tasks |
| **Chain of Thought** | Forces step-by-step reasoning for logic tasks — never applied to o1/o3 |

| 33 | **Silent agent** | No progress output | "After each step output: ✅ [what was completed]" |
| 34 | **Unlocked filesystem** | No file restrictions | "Only edit files inside `src/`. Do not touch `package.json`, `.env`, or any config file." |

## 🧠 Memory Block System

When your conversation has history, Prompt Master pulls out prior decisions and prepends a Memory Block so the AI never contradicts earlier work:

```
## Memory (Carry Forward from Previous Context)
- Stack: React 18 + TypeScript + Supabase
- Auth uses JWT stored in httpOnly cookies, not localStorage
- Component naming convention: PascalCase, no default exports
- Design system: Tailwind only, no custom CSS files
- Architecture: no Redux, context API only
```

This is the single biggest fix for long sessions. Most wasted re-prompts come from the AI forgetting what you already decided.
