## 🎯 Skill Activation

This skill uses a **3-Layer Activation System** for reliable detection.

### ✅ Phrases That Activate This Skill

The skill will automatically activate when you use phrases like:

#### Primary Activation Phrases
1. **"analyze stock"**
   - Example: "Analyze AAPL stock performance"

2. **"technical analysis for"**
   - Example: "Show me technical analysis for MSFT"

3. **"RSI indicator"**
   - Example: "What's the RSI indicator for TSLA?"

#### Workflow-Based Activation
4. **"buy signal for"**
   - Example: "Is there a buy signal for NVDA?"

5. **"compare stocks using"**
   - Example: "Compare AAPL vs GOOGL using RSI"

#### Domain-Specific Activation
6. **"MACD indicator"**
   - Example: "Show MACD indicator for AMD"

7. **"Bollinger Bands"**
   - Example: "Calculate Bollinger Bands for SPY"

#### Natural Language Variations
8. **"What's the technical setup for [TICKER]"**
   - Example: "What's the technical setup for QQQ?"

9. **"Monitor stock price"**
   - Example: "Monitor AMZN stock price and alert on RSI oversold"

10. **"Chart pattern analysis"**

### ❌ Phrases That Do NOT Activate

To prevent false positives, this skill will **NOT** activate for:

1. **Fundamental Analysis Requests**
   - Example: "What's the P/E ratio of AAPL?"
   - Reason: This skill focuses on technical analysis, not fundamentals

2. **News or Sentiment Analysis**
   - Example: "What's the latest news about TSLA?"
   - Reason: This skill analyzes price/volume data, not news sentiment

3. **General Market Education**
   - Example: "How do stocks work?"
   - Reason: This is educational content, not technical analysis

### 💡 Activation Tips

To ensure reliable activation:

**DO:**
- ✅ Use action verbs: analyze, compare, monitor, track, show
- ✅ Be specific about: stock ticker symbols (AAPL, MSFT, etc.)
- ✅ Mention: technical indicators (RSI, MACD, Bollinger Bands)
- ✅ Include context: "for trading", "technical analysis", "buy signals"

**DON'T:**
- ❌ Use vague phrases like "tell me about stocks"
- ❌ Omit key entities like ticker symbols or indicator names
- ❌ Be too generic: "analyze the market"

### 🎯 Example Activation Patterns

**Pattern 1:** Technical Indicator Analysis
```
User: "Show me RSI and MACD for AAPL"
Result: ✅ Skill activates via Keyword Layer (RSI indicator, MACD indicator)
```

**Pattern 2:** Signal Generation
```
User: "Is there a buy signal for NVDA based on technical indicators?"
Result: ✅ Skill activates via Pattern Layer (buy signal + technical)
```

**Pattern 3:** Stock Comparison
```
User: "Compare these tech stocks using momentum indicators"
Result: ✅ Skill activates via Pattern Layer (compare.*stocks)
```

## Usage

### Basic Usage

```python
# Analyze a single stock
from stock_analyzer import StockAnalyzer

analyzer = StockAnalyzer()
result = analyzer.analyze("AAPL", indicators=["RSI", "MACD"])
print(result)
```

### Advanced Usage

```python
# Compare multiple stocks with custom parameters
analyzer = StockAnalyzer()
comparison = analyzer.compare(
    tickers=["AAPL", "MSFT", "GOOGL"],
    indicators=["RSI", "MACD", "Bollinger"],
    period="1y"
)
print(comparison.ranked_by_momentum())
```

### Real-World Examples

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Skill Not Activating

**Symptoms:** Your query doesn't activate the skill

**Solutions:**
1. ✅ Use one of the activation phrases listed above
2. ✅ Include action verbs: analyze, compare, monitor, track
3. ✅ Mention specific entities: ticker symbols, indicator names
4. ✅ Provide context: "technical analysis", "using RSI"

**Example Fix:**
```
❌ "What about AAPL?"
✅ "Analyze AAPL stock using technical indicators"
```

### Issue: Wrong Skill Activates

**Symptoms:** A different skill activates instead

**Solutions:**
1. Be more specific about technical analysis
2. Use technical indicator keywords: RSI, MACD, Bollinger Bands
3. Add context that distinguishes from fundamental analysis

**Example Fix:**
```
❌ "Analyze AAPL" (too generic, might trigger fundamental analysis)
✅ "Technical analysis of AAPL using RSI and MACD" (specific to this skill)
```
