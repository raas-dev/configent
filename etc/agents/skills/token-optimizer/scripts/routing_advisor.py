"""In-session model + effort routing for the current platform.

Given a task, recommend both the model and the reasoning effort to run it with,
expressed in the terms of the platform Token Optimizer is running on. The goal
is to stop reflexively spending the top model at max effort on trivial work, and
to stop under-powering work that actually matters.

Two ideas do the work:

1. Significance. A task is classified easy / standard / hard from local signals
   only. Significance sets a FLOOR: the cheapest models and the lowest efforts
   are reachable only for easy tasks. Nothing a standard or hard task scores can
   drop it below that floor.

2. Native tiers. Each supported platform declares its own model ladder and its
   own effort control. The recommendation is always phrased in the current
   platform's names, and only the current platform's ladder is consulted.

Everything here is local, deterministic, and fails open to a safe middle
default (standard significance, never a cheap model) so a routing hiccup can
never block or mislead the caller.
