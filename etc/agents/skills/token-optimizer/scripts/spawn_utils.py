"""Cross-platform detached-subprocess spawn helpers.

On POSIX, ``start_new_session=True`` detaches the child into its own process
group. On Windows, ``start_new_session`` is silently ignored, so the child
inherits the parent's console (causing a ~1s window flash on every prompt) and
dies with the parent's job object. The Windows fix mirrors the daemon-revive
spawn in measure.py (~line 21658, CXP-1): OR together DETACHED_PROCESS,
CREATE_NEW_PROCESS_GROUP, CREATE_BREAKAWAY_FROM_JOB, and CREATE_NO_WINDOW via
getattr so the flags degrade to 0 on builds where an attribute is missing.

CREATE_NO_WINDOW (#107) is belt-and-suspenders here: Windows ignores it when
DETACHED_PROCESS is also set, so it changes nothing today, but it keeps the
invariant "every spawn site carries the no-flash flag" uniform and survives a
future refactor that drops DETACHED_PROCESS. It never makes CreateProcess fail.

Use ``detach_spawn_kwargs()`` for the raw kwargs dict, or ``spawn_detached()``
for fire-and-forget background spawns where the child must survive the parent
(session-end flush, daemon regen, rollup, etc.). ``spawn_detached`` retries
without ``CREATE_BREAKAWAY_FROM_JOB`` if ``CreateProcess`` fails with
``ACCESS_DENIED`` inside a restrictive Windows Job Object, then returns the
``Popen`` or ``None`` (never raises). After each call, the module-level
``last_spawn_used_fallback`` flag records whether the retry path was taken,
so a test (or caller) can assert the non-fallback path succeeded.

For spawns that must INHERIT the parent's stdio (hooks/run.py), do NOT use this
helper -- those need CREATE_NO_WINDOW, not DETACHED_PROCESS.
