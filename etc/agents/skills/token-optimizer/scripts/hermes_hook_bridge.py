"""Hermes hook bridge for Token Optimizer.

Thin shim that locates measure.py and shells into its subcommands (rollup,
summary, dashboard) on behalf of the Hermes plugin hooks and slash command.

Design mirrors codex_hook_bridge.py:
- Resolves measure.py via __file__ → scripts/ sibling, not hardcoded paths.
- Captures errors quietly and returns safe empty strings instead of raising.
- Never imports Hermes modules.

Assumption: this file lives in the same directory as measure.py (the scripts/
directory inside the Token Optimizer repo, or the same directory as __init__.py
in the Hermes install tree).  That directory is:
  ~/.hermes/plugins/token-optimizer/   (installed)
  skills/token-optimizer/scripts/      (repo checkout)

Either way, Path(__file__).parent / "measure.py" resolves correctly.
