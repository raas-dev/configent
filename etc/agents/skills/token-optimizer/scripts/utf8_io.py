"""Process-wide UTF-8 I/O enforcement for Token Optimizer.

Token Optimizer runs as short-lived hook / statusline subprocesses spawned by the
host CLI. On hosts where the active encoding is not UTF-8 -- Windows ANSI codepages
(cp125x), an explicit non-UTF-8 LANG/LC_ALL, or PYTHONUTF8=0 -- Python's standard
streams (and the default open() encoding) fall back to that locale charset. Session
paths and transcript content frequently contain non-ASCII text (Hebrew, CJK, accented
names); decoding or printing it then raises UnicodeDecodeError / UnicodeEncodeError,
which aborts the hook before it can identify the session.

enforce_utf8_io() makes stdout / stderr / stdin UTF-8 with errors="replace" so a
stray undecodable byte degrades gracefully instead of crashing the process. It is
idempotent and safe to call at the top of every entry point. File reads still pass
encoding="utf-8" explicitly at their call sites; this module only covers the standard
streams, which have no per-call encoding hook.

Note: scripts dispatched through hooks/run.py also inherit PYTHONUTF8=1 /
PYTHONIOENCODING=utf-8 from the parent, which additionally makes the default open()
encoding UTF-8. This shim is the belt-and-suspenders for entry points invoked
directly by a host (statusline, hook bridges, the CLI).
