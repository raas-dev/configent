"""Runtime home detection shared by Claude Code, Codex, Hermes, OpenCode, and Copilot adapters.

This module keeps runtime integration deliberately simple:

- Claude Code stays the default runtime unless another runtime is clearly indicated.
- Codex activates when CODEX_HOME is set or TOKEN_OPTIMIZER_RUNTIME=codex.
- Hermes activates when HERMES_HOME is set or TOKEN_OPTIMIZER_RUNTIME=hermes.
- OpenCode activates when an OPENCODE_* env signal or an opencode ancestor process
  is detected, or TOKEN_OPTIMIZER_RUNTIME=opencode. The ancestor scan reads full
  command lines, so OpenCode launched through node/bun (its real launch shape) is
  recognized, not only a bare ``opencode`` binary. OpenCode loads ~/.claude/skills
  by default, so this skill can be invoked from inside OpenCode; detecting it keeps
  the skill from scanning/mutating ~/.claude when the user is actually in OpenCode
  (issue #57). The ancestor signal is evaluated ahead of the Claude plugin-env
  heuristic so a coexisting Claude install on the same host can't shadow it.
- Copilot activates when COPILOT_HOME or TOKEN_OPTIMIZER_COPILOT_HOME is set, a
  `copilot` ancestor process is detected, or TOKEN_OPTIMIZER_RUNTIME=copilot.
  The Copilot hook bridge always sets the explicit override; the other signals
  are a safety net so the skill never scans/mutates ~/.claude while actually
  running under GitHub Copilot. COPILOT_HOME is Copilot's OWN variable — TO
  reads it but never asks users to set it (issue #78); TOKEN_OPTIMIZER_COPILOT_HOME
  is TO's own collision-free override.
- Callers can keep legacy variable names while resolving to the correct home.

The goal is to let Token Optimizer share one Python core while platform
adapters grow feature-by-feature on top of it.
