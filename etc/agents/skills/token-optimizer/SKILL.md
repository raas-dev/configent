# Token Optimizer

Audits a Claude Code or Codex setup, identifies context window waste, implements fixes, and measures savings.

**Target**: 5-15% context recovery through config cleanup, up to 25%+ with autocompact management.

---

## Step 0: Resolve measure.py, then gate on runtime (run this first)

> **Runtime pre-gate (environment only — touches no `~/.claude` path).** Before resolving any script
> path, check the environment directly. This keeps non-Claude runtimes from ever resolving a
> `~/.claude` path (issue #57):
> ```bash
> # OpenCode / Copilot set these; detect them WITHOUT touching ~/.claude.
> # Explicit TOKEN_OPTIMIZER_RUNTIME is authoritative and checked first (matches detect_runtime()).
> # An explicit override to a Claude/Codex runtime is authoritative (matches detect_runtime); proceed.
> # Claude plugin env vars (CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT/CLAUDE_PLUGIN_DATA) are checked BEFORE
> # OPENCODE_* env signals so a genuine Claude session with a stray OPENCODE_* export
> # is NOT stopped here — it falls through to measure.py, which resolves correctly
> # (detect_runtime step 3 beats step 4). This mirrors the Python priority order.
> if [ "${TOKEN_OPTIMIZER_RUNTIME:-}" = "claude" ] || [ "${TOKEN_OPTIMIZER_RUNTIME:-}" = "codex" ]; then
>   :  # fall through to the measure.py resolver + authoritative gate below
> elif [ "${TOKEN_OPTIMIZER_RUNTIME:-}" = "opencode" ]; then
>   echo "Token Optimizer — OpenCode runtime detected."
> elif [ "${TOKEN_OPTIMIZER_RUNTIME:-}" = "copilot" ]; then
>   echo "Token Optimizer — GitHub Copilot runtime detected."
> elif [ -n "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT:-}${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_DATA:-}" ]; then
>   :  # genuine Claude Code session; fall through to measure.py (step 3 beats step 4)
> elif [ -n "${OPENCODE_BIN:-}${OPENCODE_CONFIG_DIR:-}${OPENCODE_DATA_DIR:-}${OPENCODE_CONFIG:-}${OPENCODE_CLIENT:-}" ]; then
>   echo "Token Optimizer — OpenCode runtime detected."
> elif [ -n "${COPILOT_HOME:-}${TOKEN_OPTIMIZER_COPILOT_HOME:-}" ]; then
>   echo "Token Optimizer — GitHub Copilot runtime detected."
> fi
> ```
> - Prints **"… OpenCode runtime detected."** → **STOP. Do not resolve `measure.py`, do not run any
>   phase below.** Read `references/opencode-workflow.md` (bundled with this skill) and follow it.
>   On OpenCode, Token Optimizer runs as a native plugin; the Claude audit must not run.
> - Prints **"… GitHub Copilot runtime detected."** → **STOP** and follow the Copilot guidance for the

Resolve the script path **once, before any phase or runtime decision**. Every
command below — including the runtime gate — depends on `$MEASURE_PY`, so it
must be set first:
```bash
# Resolve measure.py to the NEWEST installed copy across channels so a stale
# plugin-cache copy never shadows a fresh install (issue #57). find -L follows the
# install.sh symlink under ~/.claude/skills; cd -P resolves it before reading each
# copy's plugin.json for its version. find (not bare globs) never errors under zsh.
MEASURE_PY=""; _best_ver=""
while IFS= read -r _cand; do
  [ -f "$_cand" ] || continue
  _root="$(cd -P -- "$(dirname -- "$_cand")/../../.." 2>/dev/null && pwd)"
  _ver="$(sed -n 's/.*"version"[[:space:]]*:[[:space:]]*"\([^"]*\)".*/\1/p' "$_root/.claude-plugin/plugin.json" 2>/dev/null | head -1)"
  [ -n "$_ver" ] || _ver="0.0.0"
  if [ -z "$_best_ver" ] || [ "$(printf '%s\n%s\n' "$_ver" "$_best_ver" | sort -t. -k1,1n -k2,2n -k3,3n -k4,4n | tail -n1)" = "$_ver" ]; then
    _best_ver="$_ver"; MEASURE_PY="$_cand"
  fi
done <<EOF
$(find -L "$HOME/.claude/skills" "$HOME/.claude/plugins/cache" "$HOME/.claude/token-optimizer" "$HOME/.codex/skills" "$HOME/.codex/plugins/cache" "$HOME/.config/opencode/plugins" -type f -name measure.py -path '*token-optimizer*/scripts/measure.py' 2>/dev/null)
EOF
if [ -z "$MEASURE_PY" ]; then echo "[Error] measure.py not found. Is Token Optimizer installed?"; exit 1; fi
```

With `$MEASURE_PY` resolved, run the runtime gate as the **first executed
command**. Its output is a hard stop, not a hint:
```bash
python3 "$MEASURE_PY" report 2>&1 | head -1
```

- Prints **"Token Optimizer — OpenCode runtime detected."** → **STOP. Run none
  of the phases below.** Read `references/opencode-workflow.md` and follow it.
  The Claude Code phases scan and mutate `~/.claude`, which is the wrong target
  when the user is in OpenCode (issue #57).
- Prints any other **"… runtime detected."** notice (for example GitHub
  Copilot) → STOP and follow that runtime's guidance, for the same reason.
- Otherwise continue: if `TOKEN_OPTIMIZER_RUNTIME=codex` or a Codex environment
  is detected, read `references/codex-workflow.md` and follow its chat-first
  workflow instead of the phases below. Genuine Claude Code proceeds to Phase 0.

---

## Phase 0: Initialize (Claude Code)

`MEASURE_PY` was already resolved in Step 0 — do **not** re-resolve it.

Read `references/phase0-setup.md` for the full setup sequence: context window detection, pre-check, backup, coordination folder, hook checks, daemon setup, and smart compaction.

---

## Phase 0.5: Keep-Warm Consent (first run only, Claude Code)

Keep-Warm is opt-in and pays off only for API-key-billed Claude Code sessions. Ask once:

```bash
python3 "$MEASURE_PY" keepwarm-consent-status   # JSON: {billing_mode, consent, should_ask}
```

If `should_ask` is `false`, skip this phase silently (subscription users are never asked; declined/enabled users keep their choice). If `should_ask` is `true`, first compute the user's own projection, then present the pitch:

```bash
python3 "$MEASURE_PY" keepwarm-backfill --json --no-fence   # read modes."probe-only".net_usd
```

Read `net_usd` under `modes."probe-only"`. If it is a positive number, include it as the projection. If backfill errors, returns nothing, or `net_usd <= 0`, drop the dollar sentence entirely (do not invent a number) and use the no-data wording below.

> **Keep your prompt cache warm automatically?** When a Claude Code session pauses past its 1h cache window and resumes, the whole prefix is re-written at up to 2x input. Keep-Warm pings the cache just before expiry (~0.1x of the prefix, max 2 pings per pause) so a resume stays warm. A history-replay projection from your own last 30 days nets ~$<net_usd>/30d at the conservative probe-only setting. A tripwire auto-disables it if pings ever stop paying for themselves, and you can turn it off any time. Enable it?

No-data wording (when backfill yields no positive projection): drop the projection sentence and say "Your savings depend on your own pause-and-resume pattern; the dashboard will show your number once pings have fired."

Then record the answer (do this exactly once). **Record the yes/no FIRST**, so an interrupted run never strands an "asked" marker with no recorded answer:

```bash
# yes:
python3 "$MEASURE_PY" keepwarm-enable
# no:
python3 "$MEASURE_PY" keepwarm-disable
```

`keepwarm-enable` and `keepwarm-disable` are terminal states, so they already satisfy `should_ask`. Only if the user defers or ignores the question (records neither) run the shown-marker so they are not re-asked next run:

```bash
python3 "$MEASURE_PY" keepwarm-consent-asked          # mark shown (sticky); use ONLY when no enable/disable was recorded
```

`keepwarm-enable` records consent and installs the scheduler (macOS); on other OSes the scheduler is pending, so it is watchdog-only. It refuses on subscription with an honest message. To confirm it is armed:

```bash
python3 "$MEASURE_PY" keepwarm-scheduler status      # JSON: installed/loaded state (macOS)
python3 "$MEASURE_PY" keepwarm-tick --dry-run        # JSON: what the next tick would decide
```

---

## Phase 0.6: Star the repo (first run only, once ever)

A one-time, no-pressure offer to star the repo. It is gated so it only ever surfaces for someone who has already gotten value (the gate checks `gh` is available, the repo is not already starred, and the user has session history). Check the gate:

```bash
python3 "$MEASURE_PY" star-status   # JSON: {consent, gh_available, already_starred, has_value, should_ask}
```

If `should_ask` is `false`, skip this phase silently (already asked, already starred, no `gh`, no value yet, or disabled via `TOKEN_OPTIMIZER_STAR_ASK=0`). If `should_ask` is `true`, make the offer warmly and briefly, and make declining effortless:

> **Enjoying Token Optimizer?** If it's been saving you tokens, a GitHub star helps other people find it. Want me to star it for you? (One tap, and I won't ask again either way.)

Then record the answer exactly once:

```bash
# yes:
python3 "$MEASURE_PY" star-now        # runs gh api -X PUT /user/starred/...; sets consent=starred
# no:
python3 "$MEASURE_PY" star-decline    # terminal; never asked again
```

Only if the user defers or ignores the question (records neither) mark it shown so they are not re-asked:

```bash
python3 "$MEASURE_PY" star-consent-asked   # mark shown (sticky); use ONLY when no star/decline was recorded
```

## Phase 1: Quick Audit (Parallel Agents)

Read `references/agent-prompts.md` for all prompt templates.

Dispatch 6 agents in parallel:

| Agent | Output File | Model | Task |
|-------|-------------|-------|------|
| CLAUDE.md Auditor | `audit/claudemd.md` | sonnet | Size, duplication, tiered content, cache structure |
| MEMORY.md Auditor | `audit/memorymd.md` | sonnet | Size, overlap with CLAUDE.md |
| Skills Auditor | `audit/skills.md` | sonnet | Count, frontmatter overhead, duplicates |
| MCP Auditor | `audit/mcp.md` | sonnet | Deferred tools, broken/unused servers |
| Commands Auditor | `audit/commands.md` | haiku | Count, menu overhead |
| Settings & Advanced | `audit/advanced.md` | sonnet | Hooks, rules, settings, @imports, caching |

Pass `COORD_PATH` to each. Wait for all to complete. If any output file is missing, note the gap and proceed.

---

## Phase 2: Analysis

Read the **Synthesis Agent** prompt from `references/agent-prompts.md`. Dispatch with `model="opus"` (fallback: sonnet). It reads all audit files and writes `{COORD_PATH}/analysis/optimization-plan.md`. If missing, present raw audit files instead.

---

## Phase 3: Present Findings

Read `references/presentation-workflow.md` for the findings template, dashboard generation, and URL presentation logic. Generate the dashboard:
```bash
python3 $MEASURE_PY dashboard --coord-path $COORD_PATH
```
Wait for user decision before proceeding.

---

## Phase 4: Implementation

Read `references/implementation-playbook.md` for detailed steps. Available actions: 4A-4P covering CLAUDE.md, MEMORY.md, Skills, File Exclusion, MCP, Hooks, Cache, Rules, Settings, Descriptions, Compact Instructions, Model Routing, Smart Compaction, Quality Check, Version-Aware Optimizations, and Smart Routing. Templates in `examples/`. Always backup before changes. Present diffs for approval.

---

## Phase 5: Verification

Read the **Verification Agent** prompt from `references/agent-prompts.md`. Dispatch with `model="haiku"`. Re-measures everything and calculates savings. Present before/after comparison and behavioral next steps.

---

## Session Continuity: Cold-Resume-Lean

Reopen a forgotten/cold session cheaply, no `--resume`, no command. On a fresh
session, when the user naturally asks to continue prior work ("continue the X
work, check what we discussed last session"), the continuity hook reconstructs a
**lean** context for the right **same-project** prior session and injects it.

- **Selection** ("both"): if the user names a topic → keyword-match winner; if
  vague ("where we left off") → most-recent same-project session.
- **Token-free**: reconstruction reads checkpoints + `session_log` only (no LLM,
  no subprocess). The only cost is the fresh session's normal first turn.
- **Same-project = files touched** (path-prefix vs cwd), never a cross-project leak.
- **Savings** are credited as a realized `resume_lean` event (avoided cold-resume
  cache-rewrite minus the lean block), idempotent per target session, shown in the
  Savings view. Realized tier, same as `checkpoint_restore`.
- **Manual fallback**: `python3 $MEASURE_PY resume-lean` lists cold sessions;
  `resume-lean <#|session_id> --print` emits the block for `claude "$(...)"`.
- Ported across Claude Code, Codex, OpenClaw, opencode (checkpoint richness varies
  by platform; the lean block adapts to available fields).

## Core Rules

- Quantify everything (X tokens, Y%)
- Create backups before any changes
- Ask user before implementing
- Never delete files, always archive outside the skills directory
- Check dependencies before archiving (skills, MCP, deny rules can break other tools)
- Warn about side effects before each change
- Prefer project-level deny rules over global
- Show before/after diffs
- Frame savings as context budget (% of window), not dollar amounts
