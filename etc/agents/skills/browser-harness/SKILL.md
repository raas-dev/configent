# browser-harness

Direct browser control via CDP. For task-specific edits, use `agent-workspace/agent_helpers.py`. For setup, install, or connection problems, read https://github.com/browser-use/browser-harness/blob/main/install.md.

Domain skills are off by default. Set `BH_DOMAIN_SKILLS=1` to enable them; see the bottom section.

**If `BH_DOMAIN_SKILLS=1` and the task is site-specific, read every file in the matching `$BH_AGENT_WORKSPACE/domain-skills/<site>/` directory before inventing an approach.**

## Usage

```bash
browser-harness <<'PY'
print(page_info())
PY
```

- Invoke as `browser-harness`. Use heredocs for multi-line commands.
- Helpers are pre-imported. `run.py` calls `ensure_daemon()` before `exec`.
- First navigation is `new_tab(url)`, not `goto_url(url)`.
- The normal local flow attaches to the running Chrome/Chromium CDP endpoint. No browser ids or local profile selection.

## Local Chrome

If the daemon cannot connect, run diagnostics:

```bash
browser-harness --doctor
```

If Chrome remote debugging is not enabled, the harness opens:

```text
chrome://inspect/#remote-debugging
```

Ask the user to tick "Allow remote debugging for this browser instance" and click Allow if Chrome shows a permission popup. Then retry the same `browser-harness` command.

## Remote Browsers

Use Browser Use cloud for headless servers, parallel sub-agents, or isolated work. Authenticate once:

```bash
browser-harness auth login
```

Or import a key safely:

```bash
browser-harness auth login --api-key-stdin
```

Pick a short made-up name; `r7k2` below is just a placeholder:

```bash
browser-harness <<'PY'
start_remote_daemon("r7k2")
PY

BU_NAME=r7k2 browser-harness <<'PY'
new_tab("https://example.com")
print(page_info())
PY
```

When the task is done and a cloud browser is still running, ask directly: "Should I close this browser now?" If yes, run `stop_remote_daemon(name)`. Remote daemons bill until they stop or time out.

Do not start a remote daemon and then keep using the default daemon. Use the same name for `BU_NAME`.

## Page Workflow

- Screenshots first: use `capture_screenshot()` to understand visible state.
- Clicking: screenshot -> read pixel -> `click_at_xy(x, y)` -> screenshot again.
- After navigation, call `wait_for_load()`.
- If the current tab is stale or internal, call `ensure_real_tab()`.
- Use `js(...)` for DOM inspection or extraction when coordinates are the wrong tool.
- Login walls: stop and ask. Exception: use available SSO automatically when Chrome is already signed in; still stop for passwords, MFA, consent, or ambiguous account choice.
- Raw CDP is available with `cdp("Domain.method", ...)`.

- uploads.md
- viewport.md

## Design Constraints

- Coordinate clicks default. CDP mouse events pass through iframes/shadow/cross-origin at the compositor level.
- Keep the connection model simple: use the default daemon, `BU_NAME`, `BU_CDP_URL`, `BU_CDP_WS`, or `start_remote_daemon(...)`.
- Core helpers stay short. Put task-specific helper additions in `$BH_AGENT_WORKSPACE/agent_helpers.py`.

## Gotchas

- `chrome://inspect/#remote-debugging` must be enabled for local Chrome control.
- Chrome may show an "Allow remote debugging?" popup; wait for the user to click Allow.
- Omnibox popups are not real work tabs.
- CDP target order is not Chrome's visible tab-strip order.
- `BU_CDP_URL` is an HTTP DevTools endpoint; the daemon resolves it to WebSocket.
- Ask before leaving cloud browsers running; stop them with `stop_remote_daemon(name)` or `PATCH /browsers/{id} {"action":"stop"}`.

## Domain Skills

Only applies when `BH_DOMAIN_SKILLS=1`. Otherwise ignore domain skills.

When enabled, search `$BH_AGENT_WORKSPACE/domain-skills/<host>/` before inventing an approach. `goto_url(...)` returns up to 10 skill filenames for the navigated host.
