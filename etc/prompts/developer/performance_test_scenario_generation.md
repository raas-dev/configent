**Objective:** Create realistic performance test scenarios that can be used to simulate high load conditions and identify potential bottlenecks in the codebase.

**Instructions:**

1. **Consider realistic user behavior:** Analyze typical user workflows and interactions with the system.
2. **Identify critical user flows:** Focus on simulating user actions that are most likely to stress the system under high load, such as:
    -  User login/authentication
    -  Searching for products or content
    -  Adding items to a shopping cart
    -  Placing orders
3. **Determine user load and distribution:**
    - Estimate the expected number of concurrent users during peak hours.
    - Define the geographic distribution of users, if relevant.
4. **Specify performance metrics:** Clearly define the key performance indicators (KPIs) to be measured during the tests, such as:
    -  Response time
    -  Throughput (transactions per second)
    -  Error rate
    - Resource utilization (CPU, memory, network)
5. **Use a performance testing tool:** Structure the test scenarios in a format compatible with a performance testing tool like JMeter, Gatling, or Locust.

**Expected Output:** A set of performance test scenarios, defined in a suitable format for a chosen testing tool, that:

-  Realistically simulate user behavior and load patterns.
-  Target critical user flows to stress the system under high load.
-  Include clear performance metrics and thresholds for evaluating system performance.
