# Code Evolution Visualization

**Objective:** Create visualizations that illustrate how the codebase has evolved over time, highlighting key milestones, refactorings, and architectural changes.

**Instructions:**
1. Analyze the version control history of the codebase to identify significant changes and milestones.
2. Design a timeline visualization that showcases the major events in the codebase's evolution, such as feature additions, refactorings, and architectural shifts.
3. Use color-coding, annotations, and icons to differentiate between different types of changes and their impact on the codebase.
4. Provide brief descriptions or links to relevant documentation for each milestone to give context and facilitate further exploration.
5. Consider creating interactive visualizations that allow users to zoom in on specific time periods or filter changes by type or author.

**Expected Output:** A set of engaging and informative visualizations that help developers understand the historical context of the codebase and appreciate the work that has gone into its development.
