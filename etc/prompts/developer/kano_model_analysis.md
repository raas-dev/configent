# Kano Model Analysis for Codebase

**Objective:** Analyze the codebase and its associated product features using the Kano Model to prioritize development efforts based on their impact on customer satisfaction.

**Instructions:**

1. Review the codebase and identify the key features and functionalities it provides.
2. For each feature, analyze its potential impact on customer satisfaction using the Kano Model categories:

   a. Must-be (Basic) Features:
      - These are features that customers expect and take for granted.
      - Their absence leads to extreme dissatisfaction, but their presence does not increase satisfaction.

   b. One-dimensional (Performance) Features:
      - These features result in satisfaction when fulfilled and dissatisfaction when not fulfilled.
      - The level of satisfaction is proportional to the level of fulfillment.

   c. Attractive (Excitement) Features:
      - These features are not expected by customers but can lead to high satisfaction if present.
      - Their absence does not lead to dissatisfaction.

   d. Indifferent Features:
      - These features do not have a significant impact on customer satisfaction, whether present or absent.

   e. Reverse Features:
      - These features lead to dissatisfaction when present and satisfaction when absent.

3. Prioritize features based on their Kano Model classification and their alignment with business objectives.
4. Identify potential new features that could serve as Attractive (Excitement) features to delight customers.
5. Develop a roadmap for implementing and improving features based on their Kano Model prioritization.

**Expected Output:** A comprehensive Kano Model analysis of the codebase and its associated features, including:
- Classification of each feature into the Kano Model categories (Must-be, One-dimensional, Attractive, Indifferent, Reverse)
- Prioritization of features based on their Kano Model classification and business alignment
- Identification of potential new Attractive (Excitement) features
- Roadmap for feature implementation and improvement based on Kano Model prioritization
