**Objective:** Provide specific refactoring recommendations based on the analysis of code evolution and historical data. Focus on areas where past code changes, churn, or technical debt indicate a need for improvement.

**Instructions:**

1. **Review code evolution analysis:**  Consider the results from code churn analysis, technical debt estimation, and other historical code assessments.
2. **Identify refactoring opportunities:** Look for areas where:
    - Code churn is consistently high, indicating potential design flaws or areas that are difficult to maintain.
    - Technical debt has accumulated, making the code hard to understand or modify.
    -  Architectural inconsistencies have emerged over time due to various changes and additions.
3. **Suggest specific refactoring actions:** Provide concrete recommendations, such as:
    -  Extracting methods or classes to improve code organization and reduce complexity.
    -  Applying design patterns to improve flexibility and maintainability.
    -  Removing code smells or anti-patterns.
4. **Prioritize recommendations:**  Rank the suggestions based on:
    -  Their potential impact on code quality and maintainability.
    -  The feasibility and effort required to implement them.

**Expected Output:** A prioritized list of refactoring recommendations that:

-  Clearly identifies the specific areas of the codebase that need improvement.
-  Provides specific refactoring actions to be taken (e.g., "Extract Method", "Apply Strategy Pattern").
-  Explains the rationale behind each recommendation and the expected benefits.
