# Blue Ocean Strategy Analysis for Codebase

**Objective:** Analyze the codebase to identify opportunities for creating uncontested market space and generating new demand, based on the principles of Blue Ocean Strategy.

**Instructions:**

1. Review the codebase and identify key features and functionalities.
2. Analyze the industry landscape and existing solutions:
   - What are the common features and assumptions in the industry?
   - What factors do competitors typically compete on?
3. Identify opportunities for value innovation:
   - How can the codebase eliminate features that the industry takes for granted?
   - What features could be reduced well below the industry standard?
   - Which features could be raised well above the industry standard?
   - What features could be created that the industry has never offered?
4. Assess the potential for creating new market space:
   - How do the identified opportunities differentiate the codebase from existing solutions?
   - What new customer segments or needs could be addressed?
5. Evaluate the strategic fit and feasibility of pursuing these opportunities:
   - Are the opportunities aligned with the overall business strategy?
   - What are the potential challenges or risks in pursuing these opportunities?
6. Develop a high-level roadmap for implementing the identified blue ocean opportunities.

**Expected Output:** A comprehensive Blue Ocean Strategy analysis of the codebase, including:
- Identification of industry assumptions and factors of competition
- Opportunities for value innovation through the four actions framework (eliminate, reduce, raise, create)
- Assessment of the potential for creating uncontested market space
- Evaluation of strategic fit and feasibility
- High-level implementation roadmap
