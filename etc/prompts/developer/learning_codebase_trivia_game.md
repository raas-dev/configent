# Codebase Trivia Game Generation

**Objective:** Generate trivia questions and answers based on the codebase to gamify learning and encourage team engagement.

**Instructions:**
1. Analyze the codebase to identify interesting facts, quirks, and historical details that could serve as the basis for trivia questions.
2. Create a diverse set of multiple-choice questions covering various aspects of the codebase, such as its architecture, design patterns, performance optimizations, and notable bug fixes.
3. Ensure the questions are challenging but not overly obscure, striking a balance between testing knowledge and promoting learning.
4. Provide clear and concise explanations for each answer to reinforce understanding and share knowledge.
5. Organize the questions into categories or difficulty levels to cater to different levels of expertise.

**Expected Output:** A collection of codebase-specific trivia questions and answers that can be used to create engaging learning games for the development team.
