**Objective:** Generate visualizations that effectively represent the evolution of a codebase over time, using data from version control and other relevant sources.

**Instructions:**

1. **Determine the key aspects to visualize:**  Select the most relevant aspects of code evolution to display visually, such as:
    -  Code Churn
    -  Code Complexity
    -  Contributor Activity
    -  Growth in lines of code
    -  Evolution of directory structure
2. **Choose appropriate visualization types:**  Select chart types and visualization techniques that best represent the chosen data and insights, such as:
    -  Line charts for showing trends over time.
    -  Heatmaps for highlighting areas of high churn or complexity.
    -  Treemaps for representing the evolution of directory structures or code modules.
    -  Network graphs for visualizing relationships between code entities.
3. **Use clear and informative labels:**  Provide meaningful titles, axis labels, and legends to make the visualizations easy to understand.
4. **Focus on key insights:** Highlight the most important patterns or trends that the visualizations reveal about the codebase's evolution.

**Expected Output:**  A set of clear and informative visualizations that:

-  Effectively communicate key aspects of the codebase's evolution.
-  Use appropriate visualization techniques to represent data and insights.
-  Include clear labels and annotations for easy understanding.
-  Help identify important trends, patterns, or potential areas for improvement.
