# Backend API Documentation

**Objective:** Generate documentation for backend APIs, including endpoints, request/response formats, and authentication requirements.

**Instructions:**
1. Identify the main backend API endpoints in the codebase.
2. For each endpoint, document its HTTP method, URL path, and purpose.
3. Specify the expected request format, including headers, query parameters, and request body (if applicable).
4. Describe the response format, including the structure of the response data and any relevant status codes.
5. Detail any authentication or authorization requirements for accessing the endpoint.
6. Provide clear and concise code examples demonstrating how to interact with the API using popular tools or libraries.

**Expected Output:** Comprehensive documentation for the backend APIs, including endpoints, request/response formats, authentication requirements, and code examples, ready to be integrated into the project's documentation system.
