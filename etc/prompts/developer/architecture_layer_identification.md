**Objective:** Analyze the codebase and identify different architectural layers (e.g., presentation, business logic, data access), highlighting inconsistencies or deviations from common architectural patterns.

**Instructions:**

1. **Analyze the codebase structure:** Examine the directory structure, modules, and classes to understand how code is organized.
2. **Identify distinct layers:** Look for code sections responsible for:
    * **Presentation:** Handling user interface, user input, and displaying information (e.g., UI components, views, controllers).
    * **Business Logic:** Implementing business rules, workflows, and data processing (e.g., services, business objects, use case classes).
    * **Data Access:** Interacting with databases or external data sources (e.g., repositories, data access objects, API clients).
3. **Document each identified layer:**
    * Name the layer (e.g., "Presentation Layer", "Domain Layer", "Persistence Layer").
    * Describe its purpose and responsibilities.
    * List the key components or modules belonging to that layer.
4. **Analyze adherence to architectural patterns:**
    * Determine if the codebase follows any recognizable architectural patterns (e.g., Model-View-Controller, Model-View-ViewModel, Layered Architecture).
    * Highlight any inconsistencies or deviations from these patterns. For example, if business logic is found within the presentation layer, explain the potential implications.
5. **Provide specific code examples:**  Illustrate your findings by referencing relevant code snippets that clearly demonstrate the separation (or lack thereof) between architectural layers.

**Expected Output:** A clear and well-structured report that:

1. Identifies the architectural layers present in the codebase.
2. Describes the purpose and responsibilities of each layer.
3. Provides concrete code examples to support the analysis.
4. Analyzes the codebase's adherence to common architectural patterns and highlights any inconsistencies or deviations.
