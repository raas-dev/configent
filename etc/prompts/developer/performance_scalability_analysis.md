#### Scalability Analysis

**Objective:** Assess the codebase's ability to handle increasing loads and identify potential limitations that might hinder scalability, suggesting improvements to enhance scalability.

**Instructions:**

1. **Understand the current architecture:**  Analyze the codebase's architecture to determine its components, their interactions, and data flow.
2. **Identify scaling bottlenecks:**  Look for potential scaling limits in areas like:
    - Database: Analyze query performance under load, database connection pooling, and potential for sharding or replication.
    - Application Servers: Assess the capacity to handle concurrent requests, session management, and load balancing capabilities.
    - Network:  Evaluate network bandwidth, latency, and capacity to manage increased traffic.
    - Caching: Determine if caching mechanisms are in place and if they can be optimized for scalability.
3. **Consider different scaling strategies:** Evaluate the suitability of:
    - Vertical scaling (upgrading hardware)
    - Horizontal scaling (adding more instances)
4. **Suggest architectural improvements:** Recommend changes to the codebase or infrastructure to address scalability limitations:
    - Introduce asynchronous processing or queuing mechanisms.
    - Optimize database interactions for concurrency.
    - Implement distributed caching solutions.
    -  Consider microservices architecture for independent scaling of components.

**Expected Output:** A detailed report covering:

- An assessment of the codebase's current scalability.
-  Identification of potential bottlenecks and their impact.
-  Specific recommendations for architectural changes, code optimization, or infrastructure adjustments to improve scalability.
