# Unit Test Generation for Codebase

**Objective:** Generate unit tests for the provided codebase to ensure code correctness and prevent regressions.

**Instructions:**

1. **Analyze the attached code** and identify its core functions and methods.
2. **Generate unit tests** that cover a wide range of input values and expected outputs for each function/method.
3. **Follow best practices for unit testing**, including:
    * **Test one function/method per test case.**
    * **Use descriptive test names.**
    * **Assert expected outcomes clearly.**
    * **Keep tests independent and isolated.**
4. **Prioritize test coverage for critical functionalities** and edge cases.

**Expected Output:** A comprehensive suite of unit tests that can be used to verify the correctness of the codebase and prevent regressions during future development.
