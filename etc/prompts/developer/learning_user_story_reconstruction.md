# Revised Prompt: Structured User Story Analysis for Software Development

## Objective
Reconstruct and structure the user stories that likely served as the basis for the development of the provided codebase, and identify potential enhancements.

## Instructions

1. Analyze the attached code to identify the core functionalities of the application.
2. Infer the user needs that each functionality aims to address.
3. Categorize the functionalities into key areas (e.g., Core Features, User Interface, Data Processing, etc.).
4. For each category, formulate user stories using the following enhanced template:
   ```
   User Role: [Specific role or type of user]
   Need: [What the user wants to accomplish]
   Functionality: [The feature or capability that addresses the need]
   Benefit: [The value or advantage gained by the user]
   ```
5. Identify potential missing user stories, categorizing them similarly.
6. Suggest functionalities that could be added to the application to better meet user needs.

## Expected Output

1. **Reconstructed User Stories**
   * Organized by categories (e.g., Core Features, User Interface, etc.)
   * Each category should contain:
     - A brief description of the category
     - A numbered list of user stories in the enhanced template format

2. **Potential Missing User Stories**
   * Organized by categories (similar to reconstructed stories)
   * Each category should contain:
     - A brief description of why these stories might be valuable
     - A numbered list of potential user stories in the enhanced template format

3. **Enhancement Suggestions**
   * A brief overview of key areas for potential improvement
   * A prioritized list of suggested new functionalities or features, with a brief rationale for each

## Additional Guidelines

* Aim for clarity and specificity in user roles and needs.
* Ensure that each user story is distinct and non-redundant.
* Consider various stakeholders (e.g., end-users, administrators, developers) when formulating stories.
* For missing stories and enhancements, focus on additions that would significantly improve the application's value or usability.
