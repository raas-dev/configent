#### Code Churn Hotspot Analysis

**Objective:** Analyze the codebase's commit history to identify areas with high churn rates (frequent changes), which often indicate areas that are complex, error-prone, or in need of refactoring.

**Instructions:**

1. **Access the Version Control System (VCS):**  Obtain the commit history from the codebase's version control system (e.g., Git).
2. **Calculate code churn:** For each file or code module, calculate the churn rate, which can be defined as:
    - Number of times the file has been modified
    - Number of lines of code added, deleted, or changed over a specific period.
3. **Identify hotspots:**  Identify files or modules with significantly higher churn rates compared to the rest of the codebase.
4. **Investigate the reasons for high churn:**  Try to understand why these hotspots are frequently modified. This might involve:
    -  Looking at commit messages associated with the changes.
    - Analyzing the types of changes made (bug fixes, new features, refactoring).
5. **Correlate with other metrics:** Combine churn analysis with other code quality metrics (e.g., complexity) to get a more comprehensive view of problematic areas.

**Expected Output:**  A report or visualization (e.g., a heatmap) that highlights:

- Files or modules with the highest code churn rates.
- Trends in churn over time (e.g., increasing or decreasing churn).
-  Potential reasons for high churn based on commit history analysis.
- Recommendations for refactoring or further investigation.
