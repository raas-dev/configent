# Competitive Positioning Map for Codebase

**Objective:** Create a visual map of the codebase's associated product and its competitors, positioning each based on key dimensions that are important to the target market.

**Instructions:**

1. Review the codebase and identify the key features and functionalities it provides.
2. Define the target market for the product and identify the main competitors.
3. Select two key dimensions that are important to the target market and can be used to differentiate the products. Examples might include:
   - Price vs. Quality
   - Ease of Use vs. Functionality
   - Performance vs. Customization
   - Brand Reputation vs. Innovation
4. Create a two-dimensional grid with the chosen dimensions as the axes.
5. Plot the codebase's associated product on the grid based on its relative position along the two dimensions.
6. Plot the main competitors on the grid based on their relative positions along the two dimensions.
7. Analyze the resulting map:
   - Where is the codebase's product positioned relative to competitors?
   - Are there any gaps or clusters in the market?
   - Is the codebase's product positioned in a way that aligns with its target market and value proposition?
8. Identify opportunities for differentiating or repositioning the codebase's product based on the competitive landscape.
9. Develop strategies for strengthening the product's position and competing effectively in the market.

**Expected Output:** A visual Competitive Positioning Map for the codebase's associated product, including:
- A two-dimensional grid with labeled axes representing the chosen key dimensions
- The codebase's product plotted on the grid based on its relative position
- Main competitors plotted on the grid based on their relative positions
- Analysis of the product's position relative to competitors and market gaps/clusters
- Identification of opportunities for differentiation and repositioning
- Strategies for strengthening the product's competitive position
