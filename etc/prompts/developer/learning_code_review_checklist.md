# Code Review Checklist Generation

**Objective:** Generate a checklist of important points to consider during code reviews, based on the codebase's specific requirements and best practices.

**Instructions:**
1. Review the codebase and identify the key aspects that should be considered during code reviews, such as code style, performance, security, and maintainability.
2. Organize the identified aspects into categories to create a structured checklist.
3. For each category, provide specific questions or points that reviewers should consider when evaluating the code.
4. Include references to the codebase's specific conventions, guidelines, or best practices, where applicable.
5. Ensure the checklist is comprehensive yet concise, and can be easily integrated into the team's code review process.

**Expected Output:** A well-structured, codebase-specific code review checklist that helps reviewers consistently evaluate code quality, adherence to best practices, and potential issues.
