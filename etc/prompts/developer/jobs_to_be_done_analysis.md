# Jobs to be Done (JTBD) Analysis for Codebase

**Objective:** Analyze the codebase using the Jobs to be Done framework to understand the core user needs it addresses and identify potential improvements or new opportunities.

**Instructions:**

1. Review the codebase and identify key features and functionalities.

2. For each major feature or component, analyze:

   a. Functional Job:
      - What practical task does this code help the user accomplish?
      - How does it make a process more efficient or effective?

   b. Emotional Job:
      - How does this code make the user feel?
      - Does it reduce anxiety, increase confidence, or provide a sense of accomplishment?

   c. Social Job:
      - How does this code help the user in their social or professional context?
      - Does it improve status, strengthen relationships, or enhance reputation?

3. Identify the circumstances that trigger the use of each feature:
   - What situation prompts the user to engage with this functionality?
   - What are the user's goals and constraints in this moment?

4. Analyze the current solutions and workarounds:
   - How are users currently addressing these jobs without your code?
   - What are the limitations or frustrations with existing solutions?

5. Evaluate how well the code fulfills each identified job:
   - Does it fully satisfy the user's needs?
   - Are there aspects of the job that are not adequately addressed?

6. Identify potential improvements or new opportunities:
   - How could existing features be enhanced to better fulfill the jobs?
   - Are there unaddressed jobs that present new development opportunities?

7. Prioritize potential enhancements based on their importance to users and alignment with business goals.

**Expected Output:** A comprehensive analysis of the codebase through the Jobs to be Done lens, highlighting how well it addresses user needs, identifying gaps, and suggesting prioritized improvements or new features to better fulfill user jobs.
