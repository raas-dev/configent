# Code Complexity Analysis

**Objective:** Analyze the codebase to identify areas with high cyclomatic complexity, deep nesting, or excessive method lengths, providing insights into potential readability and maintainability issues.

**Instructions:**

1. Review the codebase and identify areas with:
   - High cyclomatic complexity
   - Deep nesting
   - Excessive method lengths

2. For each identified issue, analyze:
   a. Location:
      - File path
      - Line number(s)

   b. Description:
      - Brief explanation of the complexity issue

   c. Impact:
      - Potential effects on code readability
      - Potential effects on code maintainability

   d. Refactoring Suggestions:
      - Propose methods to simplify or restructure the code
      - Suggest alternative approaches to reduce complexity

3. If no significant issues are found, provide a summary stating that the codebase has acceptable complexity levels.

4. Consider the overall complexity trends in the codebase:
   - Are there specific areas or modules that consistently show higher complexity?
   - Are there patterns in the types of complexity issues encountered?

5. Suggest general best practices or coding standards that could help prevent future complexity issues.

**Expected Output:** A comprehensive analysis of the codebase's complexity, detailing specific issues found, their impact, and suggestions for improvement. The report should include:

1. An overview of the complexity analysis findings
2. Detailed breakdowns of each identified issue
3. General recommendations for maintaining code simplicity
4. If applicable, a summary of complexity trends or patterns observed in the codebase

For each identified issue, use the following format:

File: [file path]
Line(s): [line number(s)]
Issue: [brief description]
Impact: [potential impact on readability and maintainability]
Suggestions:
- [refactoring suggestion 1]
- [refactoring suggestion 2]
