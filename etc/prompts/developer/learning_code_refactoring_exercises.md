# Code Refactoring Exercises

**Objective:** Generate code refactoring exercises based on the codebase to help engineers improve their refactoring skills.

**Instructions:**
1. Identify areas in the codebase that could benefit from refactoring, such as duplicated code, long functions, or complex conditional statements.
2. For each identified area, create a refactoring exercise that challenges engineers to improve the code's design, readability, and maintainability.
3. Provide a clear problem statement, including the current code snippet and the desired outcomes of the refactoring exercise.
4. Include any necessary constraints or guidelines for the refactoring process.
5. Develop a set of test cases to help engineers validate the correctness of their refactored code.

**Expected Output:** A collection of code refactoring exercises, each with a problem statement, code snippet, desired outcomes, constraints, and test cases, suitable for use in training or skill development sessions.
