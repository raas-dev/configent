**Objective:** Estimate the amount of technical debt present in the codebase based on historical code analysis, focusing on identifying areas where past code evolution has led to accumulated technical debt.

**Instructions:**

1. **Analyze commit history:**  Examine commit messages, code changes, and refactoring patterns over time to identify potential sources of technical debt, such as:
    -  Hasty bug fixes or workarounds that weren't properly addressed.
    -  Lack of consistent coding standards or code reviews, leading to inconsistent code style and potential issues.
    -  Postponed refactoring or architectural improvements.
2. **Identify code quality indicators:** Look for signs of technical debt based on historical changes, such as:
    -  Increased code complexity over time.
    -  High code churn in specific areas, indicating frequent rework or fixes.
    -  Presence of code smells or anti-patterns that have accumulated over time.
3. **Estimate the impact:**  Assess the potential consequences of the identified technical debt:
    -  Increased maintenance effort and costs.
    -  Reduced development velocity due to difficult-to-understand or modify code.
    - Increased risk of bugs or regressions.
4. **Prioritize areas for refactoring:**  Rank areas with high technical debt based on their potential impact and the feasibility of addressing them.

**Expected Output:** A technical debt report that provides:

- An overview of the estimated technical debt in the codebase.
- Identification of specific areas with high technical debt, supported by evidence from the code's history.
-  An assessment of the potential impact of the technical debt.
-  A prioritized list of recommendations for addressing the technical debt through refactoring or code improvements.
