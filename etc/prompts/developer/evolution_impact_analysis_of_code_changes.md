**Objective:** Analyze the potential ripple effects of specific code changes (e.g., bug fixes, feature additions, refactoring) to identify areas of the codebase that might be affected and predict potential conflicts or regressions.

**Instructions:**

1. **Identify the code changes:**  Obtain a specific set of code changes, which could be:
    - A single commit
    - A pull request
    - A set of related modifications
2. **Analyze dependencies:**  Determine which modules, classes, or functions are directly or indirectly affected by the code changes by analyzing:
    -  Direct code dependencies (function calls, class inheritance, etc.).
    -  Shared data structures or global state that is modified by the changes.
3. **Predict potential impacts:**  Based on the analysis of dependencies:
    -  Identify areas where the changes might introduce bugs or regressions.
    -  Look for potential conflicts with other parts of the codebase.
    -  Assess the risk level of the changes (e.g., low risk if changes are isolated, high risk if core components are affected).
4. **Suggest testing strategies:**  Recommend specific tests or test cases that should be run to validate the code changes and mitigate the risk of regressions.

**Expected Output:** An impact analysis report that:

-  Lists all potentially affected parts of the codebase.
-  Describes the nature of the potential impact (bugs, conflicts, performance regressions).
-  Assesses the risk level of the code changes.
- Suggests targeted testing strategies to validate the changes and prevent regressions.
