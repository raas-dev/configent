#### Resource Usage Profiling

**Objective:**  Analyze the codebase to identify areas that excessively consume resources like CPU, memory, or disk I/O. Provide insights to guide optimization efforts for more efficient resource utilization.

**Instructions:**

1. **Use profiling tools:** Employ resource profiling tools to monitor and analyze CPU usage, memory allocation, and disk I/O during application execution.
2. **Identify resource-intensive operations:** Pinpoint code blocks, functions, or processes that contribute most significantly to high CPU load, excessive memory consumption, or frequent disk accesses.
3. **Analyze memory management:**
    -  Look for memory leaks, where objects are not properly released after they are no longer needed.
    -  Investigate areas with high object creation rates or large object sizes.
4. **Examine I/O operations:**
    - Identify areas with frequent file system reads or writes.
    - Analyze if data can be cached or if I/O operations can be batched for better performance.
5. **Correlate resource usage with code:** Connect the identified resource-intensive areas back to specific code segments, functions, or modules to guide optimization efforts.

**Expected Output:** A comprehensive report detailing:

- Code areas with high CPU usage, including call graphs and execution times.
-  Memory allocation hotspots, including object sizes, allocation frequencies, and potential leaks.
- Disk I/O intensive operations and recommendations for reducing or optimizing them.
- Overall insights into the codebase's resource consumption patterns and areas for potential improvement.
