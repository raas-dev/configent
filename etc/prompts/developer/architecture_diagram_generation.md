## Generate Architectural Diagram

**Objective:** Generate a clear and informative architectural diagram that visually represents the structure and components of the codebase, based on its actual structure and dependencies.

**Instructions:**

1. **Analyze the codebase:**  Examine the directory structure, modules, classes, and their relationships to understand the system's architecture.
2. **Identify key components:** Determine the major building blocks of the system, such as:
    * User Interface components
    * APIs or services
    * Databases
    * External systems
    * Business logic modules
3. **Determine relationships:** Analyze how these components interact with each other. For example:
    * Which modules depend on others?
    * How do data flows between components?
    * What are the communication protocols used?
4. **Choose a suitable diagram type:** Select a diagram type that effectively represents the architecture. Common choices include:
    * Component diagrams
    * Layered architecture diagrams
    * Data flow diagrams
5. **Generate the diagram:** Use a diagramming tool or library to create a visually appealing and informative diagram that includes:
    * Clearly labeled components
    * Well-defined relationships (e.g., arrows indicating data flow or dependencies)
    * A legend or key to explain symbols and notations

**Expected Output:** A visual representation of the codebase's architecture, either as an image file or in a text-based format that can be easily rendered (e.g., PlantUML, Mermaid). The diagram should be:

* **Accurate:** It should correctly reflect the actual structure and dependencies in the codebase.
* **Clear and Concise:** Avoid clutter and use concise labels for easy understanding.
* **Informative:** The diagram should convey the key architectural elements and their interactions effectively.
