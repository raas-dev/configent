# Backend Code Analysis

**Objective:** Analyze the backend codebase to identify best practices, potential improvements, and common pitfalls.

**Instructions:**
1. Review the backend codebase, focusing on the architecture, design patterns, and libraries used.
2. Identify areas where best practices are followed and highlight them as examples of good code.
3. Spot potential improvements in code organization, performance, scalability, or maintainability, and provide specific suggestions.
4. Look for common pitfalls or anti-patterns in the backend code and offer alternative approaches.
5. Provide code snippets to illustrate your findings and recommendations.

**Expected Output:** A detailed report on the backend codebase, including best practices, potential improvements, and common pitfalls, along with illustrative code snippets and recommendations.
