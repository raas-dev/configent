**Objective:** Provide recommendations for optimal configuration settings of databases, application servers, or other infrastructure components to enhance performance.

**Instructions:**

1. **Gather system information:** Identify the specific software versions and hardware specifications of the infrastructure components (database, application server, etc.).
2. **Understand performance goals:**  Consider the desired performance targets for response times, throughput, or resource utilization.
3. **Research configuration parameters:**  Refer to the documentation of each infrastructure component to understand the available configuration parameters and their impact on performance.
4. **Suggest optimized settings:** Based on best practices and the specific system context, recommend optimal values for key configuration parameters, such as:
    -  **Database:**  Connection pool size, buffer cache size, query cache size, indexing settings.
    - **Application Server:** Thread pool size, JVM heap size, garbage collection settings, session timeout.
    -  **Web Server:** Keep-alive settings, caching configuration, number of worker processes.
5. **Explain the rationale:**  Provide clear justifications for the recommended settings, explaining how they are expected to improve performance.

**Expected Output:** A configuration tuning guide that includes:

- A list of key configuration parameters for each relevant infrastructure component.
- Recommended optimal values for those parameters.
-  Clear explanations of the rationale behind each suggestion and its potential impact on performance.
-  Cautions or considerations for applying the configuration changes (e.g., potential impact on other aspects of the system).
