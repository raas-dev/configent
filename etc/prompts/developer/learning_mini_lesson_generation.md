# Code-Based Mini-Lesson Generation

**Objective:** Create a comprehensive series of mini-lessons that explain the key concepts implemented within the provided codebase, suitable for developers of varying skill levels.

**Instructions:**

1. **Analyze and categorize the codebase:**
   * Identify major components (e.g., frontend, backend, data processing)
   * List key technologies and frameworks used

2. **Structure the mini-lessons:**
   * Create a lesson plan with 5-10 lessons
   * Ensure a logical progression from basic to advanced concepts
   * Aim for lessons that can be completed in 15-30 minutes each

3. **For each mini-lesson:**
   * **Title:** Provide a clear, concise title
   * **Learning Objectives:** List 2-3 specific learning outcomes
   * **Introduction:** Brief overview of the concept (2-3 sentences)
   * **Main Content:**
     - Explain the concept in detail
     - Use code examples from the application (minimum 2 per lesson)
     - Highlight best practices and potential pitfalls
   * **Hands-on Exercise:** Design a practical task related to the lesson
   * **Quiz:** Include 3-5 multiple-choice questions to test understanding
   * **Additional Resources:** Provide links to relevant documentation or articles

4. **Incorporate real-world context:**
   * Explain how each concept fits into the overall application architecture
   * Discuss practical applications beyond the current codebase

5. **Ensure accessibility and engagement:**
   * Use clear, jargon-free language (or explain technical terms)
   * Include diagrams or flowcharts where appropriate
   * Suggest points for class discussion or peer programming exercises

**Expected Output:**

1. **Lesson Plan Overview:**
   * List of lessons with titles and brief descriptions
   * Estimated time for each lesson

2. **Individual Lessons:**
   * Structured as per the instructions above
   * Clearly formatted for easy reading (use markdown for code snippets)

3. **Supplementary Materials:**
   * Any additional diagrams, cheat sheets, or reference guides
   * Suggestions for further learning or advanced topics

4. **Instructor Notes:**
   * Tips for effectively delivering each lesson
   * Potential areas where students might struggle and how to address them

**Additional Guidelines:**

* Tailor explanations to an audience with basic programming knowledge but potentially unfamiliar with specific technologies used
* Encourage critical thinking and problem-solving rather than rote memorization
* Where possible, highlight connections between different parts of the codebase
* Consider including optional 'deep dive' sections for more advanced learners

**Deliverable Format:** Provide the lesson plan and all lessons in a single markdown document, with clear section dividers and a table of contents.
