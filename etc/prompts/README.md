# AI prompts library

All prompt files in this dir are created programmatically from [fabric's patterns](https://github.com/danielmiessler/Fabric/tree/main/data/patterns).

Fabric is a tool created by [Daniel Miessler](https://github.com/danielmiessler) and fabric patterns are authored by [fabric contributors](https://github.com/danielmiessler/fabric/graphs/contributors).

To (re-)create prompt files in this dir:

  ./create_prompts .

Pre-commit hooks may trim trailing spaces and empty lines on git commit.
