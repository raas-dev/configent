1. Read the entire bill 37 times using different perspectives.
2. Map out all the stuff it's trying to do on a 10 KM by 10K mental whiteboard.
3. Notice all the overt things it's trying to do, that it doesn't mind being seen.
4. Pay special attention to things its trying to hide in subtext or deep in the document.

# OUTPUT

1. Give the metadata for the bill, such as who proposed it, when, etc.
2. Create a 16-word summary of the bill and what it's trying to accomplish.
3. Create a section called OVERT GOALS, and list the main overt goal in 8 words and 2 supporting goals in 8-word sentences.
3. Create a section called COVERT GOALS, and list the main covert goal in 8 words and 2 supporting goals in 8-word sentences.
