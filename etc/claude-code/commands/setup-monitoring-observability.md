# Setup Monitoring and Observability

Setup monitoring and observability tools

## Instructions

1. **Observability Strategy Planning**
   - Analyze application architecture and monitoring requirements
   - Define key performance indicators (KPIs) and service level objectives (SLOs)
   - Plan monitoring stack architecture and data flow
   - Assess compliance and retention requirements
   - Define alerting strategies and escalation procedures

2. **Metrics Collection and Monitoring**
   - Set up application metrics collection (Prometheus, DataDog, New Relic)
   - Configure infrastructure monitoring for servers, containers, and cloud resources
   - Set up business metrics and user experience monitoring
   - Configure custom metrics for application-specific monitoring
   - Set up metrics aggregation and time-series storage

3. **Logging Infrastructure**
   - Set up centralized logging system (ELK Stack, Fluentd, Splunk)
   - Configure structured logging with consistent formats
   - Set up log aggregation and forwarding from all services
   - Configure log retention policies and archival strategies
   - Set up log parsing, enrichment, and indexing

4. **Distributed Tracing**
   - Set up distributed tracing system (Jaeger, Zipkin, AWS X-Ray)
   - Configure trace instrumentation in application code
   - Set up trace sampling and collection strategies
   - Configure trace correlation across service boundaries
   - Set up trace analysis and performance optimization

5. **Application Performance Monitoring (APM)**
   - Configure APM tools for application performance insights
   - Set up error tracking and exception monitoring
   - Configure database query monitoring and optimization
   - Set up real user monitoring (RUM) and synthetic monitoring
   - Configure performance profiling and bottleneck identification

6. **Infrastructure and System Monitoring**
   - Set up server and container monitoring (CPU, memory, disk, network)
   - Configure cloud service monitoring and cost tracking
   - Set up database monitoring and performance analysis
   - Configure network monitoring and security scanning
   - Set up capacity planning and resource optimization

7. **Alerting and Notification System**
   - Configure intelligent alerting with proper thresholds
   - Set up alert routing and escalation procedures
   - Configure notification channels (email, Slack, PagerDuty)
   - Set up alert correlation and noise reduction
   - Configure on-call scheduling and incident management

8. **Dashboards and Visualization**
   - Create comprehensive monitoring dashboards (Grafana, Kibana)
   - Set up real-time system health dashboards
   - Configure business metrics and KPI visualization
   - Create role-specific dashboards for different teams
   - Set up mobile-friendly monitoring interfaces

9. **Security Monitoring and Compliance**
   - Set up security event monitoring and SIEM integration
   - Configure compliance monitoring and audit trails
   - Set up vulnerability scanning and security alerting
   - Configure access monitoring and user behavior analytics
   - Set up data privacy and protection monitoring

10. **Incident Response and Automation**
    - Set up automated incident detection and response
    - Configure runbook automation and self-healing systems
    - Set up incident management and communication workflows
    - Configure post-incident analysis and improvement processes
    - Create monitoring maintenance and optimization procedures
    - Train team on monitoring tools and incident response procedures
