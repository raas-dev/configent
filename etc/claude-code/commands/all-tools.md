# Display All Available Development Tools

Display all available development tools

*Command originally created by IndyDevDan (YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/@indydevdan) / DislerH (GitHub: https://github.com/disler)*

## Instructions

Display all available tools from your system prompt in the following format:

1. **List each tool** with its TypeScript function signature
2. **Include the purpose** of each tool as a suffix
3. **Use double line breaks** between tools for readability
4. **Format as bullet points** for clear organization

The output should help developers understand:
- What tools are available in the current Claude Code session
- The exact function signatures for reference
- The primary purpose of each tool

Example format:
```typescript
• functionName(parameters: Type): ReturnType - Purpose of the tool

• anotherFunction(params: ParamType): ResultType - What this tool does
```

This command is useful for:
- Quick reference of available capabilities
- Understanding tool signatures
- Planning which tools to use for specific tasks
