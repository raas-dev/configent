# Prepare Release Command

Prepare and validate release packages

## Instructions

Follow this systematic approach to prepare a release: **$ARGUMENTS**

1. **Release Planning and Validation**
   - Determine release version number (semantic versioning)
   - Review and validate all features included in release
   - Check that all planned issues and features are complete
   - Verify release criteria and acceptance requirements

2. **Pre-Release Checklist**
   - Ensure all tests are passing (unit, integration, E2E)
   - Verify code coverage meets project standards
   - Complete security vulnerability scanning
   - Perform performance testing and validation
   - Review and approve all pending pull requests

3. **Version Management**
   ```bash
   # Check current version
   git describe --tags --abbrev=0

   # Determine next version (semantic versioning)
   # MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH
   # MAJOR: Breaking changes
   # MINOR: New features (backward compatible)
   # PATCH: Bug fixes (backward compatible)

   # Example version updates
   # 1.2.3 -> 1.2.4 (patch)
   # 1.2.3 -> 1.3.0 (minor)
   # 1.2.3 -> 2.0.0 (major)
   ```

4. **Code Freeze and Branch Management**
   ```bash
   # Create release branch from main
   git checkout main
   git pull origin main
   git checkout -b release/v1.2.3

   # Alternative: Use main branch directly for smaller releases
   # Ensure no new features are merged during release process
   ```

5. **Version Number Updates**
   - Update package.json, setup.py, or equivalent version files
   - Update version in application configuration
   - Update version in documentation and README
   - Update API version if applicable

   ```bash
   # Node.js projects
   npm version patch  # or minor, major

   # Python projects
   # Update version in setup.py, __init__.py, or pyproject.toml

   # Manual version update
   sed -i 's/"version": "1.2.2"/"version": "1.2.3"/' package.json
   ```

6. **Changelog Generation**

# Emergency hotfix process
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git checkout -b hotfix/critical-bug-fix

# Make minimal fix
git add .
git commit -m "hotfix: fix critical security vulnerability"

# Fast-track testing and deployment
npm test
git tag -a v1.2.4-hotfix.1 -m "Hotfix for critical security issue"
git push origin hotfix/critical-bug-fix
git push origin v1.2.4-hotfix.1
```

Remember to:
- Test everything thoroughly before release
- Communicate clearly with all stakeholders
