git for-each-ref --format='%(refname:short)|%(committerdate:short)|%(authoremail)' --sort=-committerdate refs/heads/

# Analyze file changes
git diff --stat @{1.day.ago}
```

2. Configure with your API key
3. Restart with Linear connected

Proceeding with available data..."
```

### No Recent Activity
```
"No git activity found in the last 24 hours.

Possible reasons:
1. No commits made (check your time range)
2. Working on untracked branches
3. Local changes not committed

Would you like to:
- Extend the time range?
- Check specific branches?
- Manually input your updates?"
```

## Interactive Features

```
"I've generated your standup report. Would you like to:
1. Add additional context to any item?
2. Reorder priorities for today?
3. Add missing blockers or concerns?
4. Include work done outside of git?"
```

2. **Blocker Resolution**

"I notice you have blockers. Would you like help with:
1. Drafting messages to unblock items?
2. Finding alternative approaches?
3. Identifying who can help?"
```

## Best Practices

1. **Run before standup**: Generate 15-30 minutes before meeting
2. **Be specific**: Include task IDs and measurable progress
3. **Highlight blockers early**: Don't wait until standup
4. **Keep it concise**: Focus on key updates
5. **Link to evidence**: Include commit/PR links
