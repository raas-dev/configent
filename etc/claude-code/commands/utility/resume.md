Includes full status report with resume context.

### Commit History

## Quick Resume Patterns

### Morning Standup
```
/orchestration/resume --latest --with-status
```
Perfect for daily standups - shows what you were working on and current state.

### Context Switch
```
/orchestration/resume --save-state
```
Saves current working state before switching to another orchestration.

### Team Handoff
```
/orchestration/resume --handoff
```
Generates detailed handoff notes for another developer.

## Examples

### Example 1: Quick Continue
```
/orchestration/resume --latest --pickup-where-left-off
```
Resumes exactly where you stopped, showing the in-progress task.

### Example 2: Monday Morning
```
/orchestration/resume --since friday --show-completed
```
Shows what was done Friday and what's next for Monday.

### Example 3: Multiple Projects
```
/orchestration/resume --all --summary
```
Quick overview of all active orchestrations.

## State Persistence

The command reads from:
- EXECUTION-TRACKER.md for progress metrics
- TASK-STATUS-TRACKER.yaml for current state
- Task files for detailed context
- Git for working directory state

## Best Practices

1. **Use at Session Start**: Run `/orchestration/resume` when starting work
2. **Save State**: Use `--save-state` before extended breaks
3. **Check Dependencies**: Review blocked tasks that may now be unblocked
4. **Commit Regularly**: Keep git state aligned with task progress

## Notes

- Automatically detects uncommitted changes related to tasks
- Suggests next actions based on dependencies and priorities
- Integrates with git worktrees if in use
- Preserves task history for full context
