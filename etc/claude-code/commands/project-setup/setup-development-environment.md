# Setup Development Environment

Setup complete development environment

## Instructions

1. **Environment Analysis and Requirements**
   - Analyze current project structure and technology stack
   - Identify required development tools and dependencies
   - Check existing development environment configuration
   - Determine team size and collaboration requirements
   - Assess platform requirements (Windows, macOS, Linux)

2. **Core Development Tools Installation**
   - Verify and install required runtime environments (Node.js, Python, Java, etc.)
   - Set up package managers with proper versions (npm, yarn, pnpm, pip, maven, etc.)
   - Install and configure version control tools (Git, Git LFS)
   - Set up code editors with workspace-specific settings (VSCode, IntelliJ)
   - Configure terminal and shell environment

3. **Project-Specific Tooling**
   - Install project dependencies and dev dependencies
   - Set up build tools and task runners
   - Configure bundlers and module systems
   - Install testing frameworks and runners
   - Set up debugging tools and extensions
   - Configure profiling and performance monitoring tools

4. **Code Quality and Standards**
   - Install and configure linting tools (ESLint, Pylint, etc.)
   - Set up code formatting tools (Prettier, Black, etc.)
   - Configure pre-commit hooks with Husky or similar
   - Set up code spell checking and grammar tools
   - Configure import sorting and organization tools
   - Set up code complexity and quality metrics

5. **Development Server and Database**
   - Set up local development server with hot reloading
   - Configure database server and management tools
   - Set up containerized development environment (Docker)
   - Configure API mocking and testing tools
   - Set up local SSL certificates for HTTPS development
   - Configure environment variable management

6. **IDE and Editor Configuration**
   - Configure workspace settings and extensions
   - Set up language-specific plugins and syntax highlighting
   - Configure IntelliSense and auto-completion
   - Set up debugging configurations and breakpoints
   - Configure integrated terminal and task running
   - Set up code snippets and templates

7. **Environment Variables and Secrets**
   - Create .env template files for different environments
   - Set up local environment variable management
   - Configure secrets management for development
   - Set up API keys and service credentials
   - Configure environment-specific configuration files
   - Document required environment variables

8. **Documentation and Knowledge Base**
   - Create comprehensive setup documentation
   - Document common development workflows
   - Set up project wiki or knowledge base
   - Create troubleshooting guides for common issues
   - Document coding standards and best practices
   - Set up onboarding checklist for new team members

9. **Collaboration and Communication Tools**
   - Configure team communication channels
   - Set up code review workflows and tools
   - Configure issue tracking and project management
   - Set up shared development resources and services
   - Configure team calendars and meeting tools
   - Set up shared documentation and file storage

10. **Validation and Testing**
    - Verify all tools and dependencies are properly installed
    - Test development server startup and hot reloading
    - Validate database connections and data access
    - Test build processes and deployment workflows
    - Verify code quality tools are working correctly
    - Test collaboration workflows and team access
    - Create development environment health check script
