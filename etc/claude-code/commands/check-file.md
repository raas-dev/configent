# File Analysis Tool

Perform comprehensive analysis of $ARGUMENTS to identify code quality issues, security vulnerabilities, and optimization opportunities.

## Task

I'll analyze the specified file and provide detailed insights on:

1. Code quality metrics and maintainability
2. Security vulnerabilities and best practices
3. Performance bottlenecks and optimization opportunities
4. Dependency usage and potential issues
5. TypeScript/JavaScript specific patterns and improvements
6. Test coverage and missing tests

## Process

I'll follow these steps:

1. Read and parse the target file
2. Analyze code structure and complexity
3. Check for security vulnerabilities and anti-patterns
4. Evaluate performance implications
5. Review dependency usage and imports
6. Provide actionable recommendations for improvement

## Analysis Areas

### Code Quality
- Cyclomatic complexity and maintainability metrics
- Code duplication and refactoring opportunities
- Naming conventions and code organization
- TypeScript type safety and best practices

### Security Assessment
- Input validation and sanitization
- Authentication and authorization patterns
- Sensitive data exposure risks
- Common vulnerability patterns (XSS, injection, etc.)

### Performance Review
- Bundle size impact and optimization opportunities
- Runtime performance bottlenecks
- Memory usage patterns
- Lazy loading and code splitting opportunities

### Best Practices
- Framework-specific patterns (React, Vue, Angular)
- Modern JavaScript/TypeScript features usage
- Error handling and logging practices
- Testing patterns and coverage gaps

I'll provide specific, actionable recommendations tailored to your project's technology stack and architecture.
