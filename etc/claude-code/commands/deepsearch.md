Search task: $ARGUMENTS

## Search Enhancement Instructions
- Use multiple search strategies (glob patterns, grep, AST search)
- Search across ALL relevant file types
- Include hidden files and directories when appropriate
- Try alternative naming conventions (camelCase, snake_case, kebab-case)
- Look in common locations: src/, lib/, utils/, helpers/, services/
- Check for related files (tests, types, interfaces)
- Report ALL findings, not just the first match
- If initial search fails, try broader patterns
