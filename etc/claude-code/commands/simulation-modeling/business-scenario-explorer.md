# Business Scenario Explorer

Explore multiple business timeline scenarios with constraint validation and decision optimization.

## Instructions

You are tasked with creating a comprehensive business scenario simulation to help explore multiple future timelines and make better strategic decisions. Follow this systematic approach: **$ARGUMENTS**

### 1. Prerequisites Assessment

**Before proceeding, validate these critical inputs:**

- **Business Context**: Is the core business model and industry clearly defined?
- **Time Horizon**: What is the planning timeline (quarters, years, market cycles)?
- **Key Variables**: What are the primary factors that could change outcomes?
- **Success Metrics**: How will you measure scenario success/failure?
- **Decision Points**: What specific decisions need to be made?

**If any of these are unclear, use progressive questioning:**

```
Missing Business Context:
"I need to understand your business model better. Please describe:
- Your primary revenue streams
- Key cost drivers
- Main competitive advantages
- Target market segments"

Missing Time Horizon:
"What planning period should we simulate?
- Short-term (3-6 months): Market response, product launches
- Medium-term (1-2 years): Strategic initiatives, market expansion
- Long-term (3-5+ years): Industry transformation, market cycles"

Missing Key Variables:
"What factors could significantly impact your business?
- Market conditions (growth, recession, disruption)
- Competitive landscape changes
- Regulatory shifts
- Technology adoption
- Customer behavior evolution"
```

### 2. Constraint Modeling

**Map the decision environment with systematic constraint analysis:**

#### External Constraints
- Market size and growth dynamics
- Competitive positioning and responses
- Regulatory environment and compliance requirements
- Economic conditions and cycles
- Technology adoption curves
- Supply chain dependencies

#### Internal Constraints
- Financial resources and burn rate
- Team capabilities and capacity
- Technology infrastructure limitations
- Brand positioning and reputation
- Customer base characteristics
- Operational scalability factors

#### Temporal Constraints
- Product development cycles
- Market timing windows
- Seasonal business patterns
- Contract and partnership timelines
- Regulatory approval processes

**Quality Gate**: Validate that constraints are:
- Specific and measurable
- Based on real data where possible
- Include ranges/uncertainty bounds
- Account for interdependencies

### 3. Scenario Architecture

**Design multiple timeline branches systematically:**

#### Base Case Scenario
- Most likely outcome given current trajectory
- Conservative assumptions about key variables
- Historical pattern extrapolation
- Risk-adjusted projections

#### Optimistic Scenarios (2-3 variants)
- Best-case market conditions
- Successful execution of all initiatives
- Favorable competitive dynamics
- Accelerated adoption/growth

#### Pessimistic Scenarios (2-3 variants)
- Economic downturn impact
- Increased competition
- Execution challenges
- Regulatory headwinds

#### Disruption Scenarios (2-3 variants)
- Technology breakthrough impacts
- New market entrants
- Business model shifts
- Black swan events

**Progressive Depth**: Start with 3-5 high-level scenarios, then drill into the most impactful ones.

### 4. Timeline Compression Simulation

**Run accelerated scenario testing:**

#### Quarter-by-Quarter Analysis
- Revenue progression under each scenario
- Cost structure evolution
- Market share dynamics
- Key milestone achievement

#### Decision Point Mapping
- Critical decisions required at each timeline juncture
- Option values and decision trees
- Point-of-no-return identification
- Pivot opportunity windows

#### Feedback Loop Modeling
- How early results would inform later decisions
- Adaptive strategy adjustments
- Learning and refinement cycles

### 5. Quantitative Modeling

**Apply systematic measurement to scenarios:**

#### Financial Projections
- Revenue growth trajectories
- Profit margin evolution
- Cash flow dynamics
- Investment requirements
- ROI calculations across timelines

#### Market Dynamics
- Market share progression
- Customer acquisition costs
- Lifetime value evolution
- Competitive response modeling

#### Operational Metrics
- Team scaling requirements
- Infrastructure capacity needs
- Efficiency improvements
- Quality indicators

**Confidence Scoring**: Rate each projection 1-10 based on:
- Data quality supporting the assumption
- Historical precedent availability
- Expert validation received
- Logical consistency with other assumptions

### 6. Risk Assessment & Mitigation

**Systematically evaluate scenario risks:**

#### Probability Weighting
- Assign realistic probabilities to each scenario
- Use base rate analysis from similar situations
- Account for planning fallacy and optimism bias
- Include expert opinion and market research

#### Impact Analysis
- Quantify potential upside/downside for each scenario
- Identify business-critical failure modes
- Map cascade effects and domino risks
- Calculate expected value across scenarios

#### Mitigation Strategies
- Identify early warning indicators for each scenario
- Design adaptive responses and pivot strategies
- Build option values and flexibility into plans
- Create risk monitoring dashboards

### 7. Decision Optimization

**Generate actionable strategic guidance:**

#### Strategy Robustness Testing
- Which strategies perform well across multiple scenarios?
- What are the key sensitivity factors?
- Where are the highest-leverage decision points?
- What creates competitive moats in each timeline?

#### Resource Allocation Optimization
- Optimal budget allocation across scenarios
- Investment sequencing and timing
- Capability building priorities
- Partnership and acquisition strategies

#### Contingency Planning
- Specific action triggers for each scenario
- Resource reallocation frameworks
- Communication strategies for different outcomes
- Stakeholder management approaches

### 8. Calibration and Validation

**Ensure simulation quality and accuracy:**

#### Assumption Testing
- Compare key assumptions to historical data
- Validate with domain experts and stakeholders
- Stress-test critical assumptions
- Document confidence levels and sources

#### Scenario Plausibility Check
- Do scenarios follow logical progression?
- Are interdependencies properly modeled?
- Do financial projections balance?
- Are timelines realistic given constraints?

#### Bias Detection
- Check for anchoring on current state
- Identify confirmation bias in favorable scenarios
- Validate pessimistic scenarios aren't too extreme
- Ensure scenarios cover full possibility space

### 9. Output Generation

**Present findings in structured, actionable format:**
