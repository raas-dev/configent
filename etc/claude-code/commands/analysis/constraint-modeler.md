# Constraint Modeler

Model world constraints with assumption validation, dependency mapping, and scenario boundary definition.

## Instructions

You are tasked with systematically modeling the constraints that govern your decision environment to create accurate simulations and scenarios. Follow this approach: **$ARGUMENTS**

### 1. Prerequisites Assessment

**Critical Constraint Context Validation:**

- **Domain Definition**: What system/environment are you modeling constraints for?
- **Constraint Types**: Physical, economic, regulatory, technical, or social constraints?
- **Impact Scope**: How do these constraints affect decisions and outcomes?
- **Change Dynamics**: Are constraints static or do they evolve over time?
- **Validation Sources**: What data/expertise can verify constraint accuracy?

**If context is unclear, guide systematically:**

```
Missing Domain Context:
"I need to understand what you're modeling constraints for:
- Business Domain: Market constraints, competitive dynamics, regulatory environment
- Technical Domain: System limitations, performance bounds, technology constraints
- Operational Domain: Resource constraints, process limitations, capacity bounds
- Financial Domain: Budget constraints, investment limitations, economic factors

Examples:
- 'SaaS business operating in regulated healthcare market'
- 'Manufacturing system with supply chain and quality constraints'
- 'Software architecture with performance and scalability requirements'"

Missing Constraint Types:
"What types of constraints are most relevant to your decisions?
- Hard Constraints: Absolute limits that cannot be violated
- Soft Constraints: Preferences and trade-offs that can be managed
- Regulatory Constraints: Legal and compliance requirements
- Resource Constraints: Budget, time, and capacity limitations
- Market Constraints: Customer behavior and competitive dynamics"
```

### 2. Constraint Taxonomy Framework

**Systematically categorize and structure constraints:**

#### Hard Constraints (Cannot be violated)
```
Physical/Natural Constraints:
- Laws of physics and natural limitations
- Geographic and spatial boundaries
- Time and temporal restrictions
- Resource scarcity and finite capacity

Regulatory/Legal Constraints:
- Compliance requirements and legal mandates
- Industry standards and certification requirements
- Contractual obligations and agreements
- Intellectual property and licensing restrictions

Technical Constraints:
- System capacity and performance limits
- Technology compatibility and integration requirements
- Security and privacy constraints
- Infrastructure limitations and dependencies
```

#### Soft Constraints (Can be managed/traded off)
```
Economic Constraints:
- Budget limitations and financial resources
- Cost optimization and efficiency targets
- Investment return requirements and payback periods
- Market pricing and competitive pressure

Organizational Constraints:
- Team capacity and skill limitations
- Cultural and change management factors
- Decision-making processes and approval cycles
- Risk tolerance and strategic priorities

Market Constraints:
- Customer preferences and behavior patterns
- Competitive dynamics and response patterns
- Market timing and seasonal factors
- Distribution channel limitations and requirements
```

#### Dynamic Constraints (Change over time)
```
Evolutionary Constraints:
- Technology advancement and obsolescence cycles
- Market maturation and customer evolution
- Regulatory changes and policy shifts
- Competitive landscape evolution

Cyclical Constraints:
- Seasonal business patterns and market cycles
- Economic cycles and market conditions
- Budget cycles and resource allocation patterns
- Technology refresh and upgrade cycles
```

### 3. Constraint Mapping and Visualization

**Create comprehensive constraint relationship models:**

#### Constraint Interaction Matrix
```
Constraint Relationship Analysis:

Primary Constraints → Secondary Effects:
- Budget Limitation → Team size → Development capacity → Feature scope
- Regulatory Requirement → Compliance process → Timeline extension → Market timing
- Technical Constraint → Architecture choice → Scalability → Growth potential

Constraint Conflicts and Trade-offs:
- Speed vs. Quality: Time constraint vs. quality constraint
- Cost vs. Capability: Budget constraint vs. feature constraint
- Security vs. Usability: Security constraint vs. user experience constraint
- Scale vs. Simplicity: Growth constraint vs. complexity constraint

Constraint Dependencies:
- Sequential: Constraint A must be satisfied before addressing Constraint B
- Conditional: Constraint A applies only if Condition X is true
- Mutual: Constraints A and B reinforce or conflict with each other
- Hierarchical: Constraint A contains or encompasses Constraint B
```

#### Constraint Hierarchy Modeling
- Strategic level constraints (mission, vision, values)
- Tactical level constraints (resources, capabilities, market position)
- Operational level constraints (processes, systems, daily operations)
- Individual level constraints (skills, capacity, availability)

### 4. Assumption Validation Framework

**Systematically test and validate constraint assumptions:**

#### Assumption Documentation
```
Constraint Assumption Template:

Constraint: [Name and description]
Assumption: [What we believe to be true about this constraint]
Source: [Where this assumption comes from]
Confidence Level: [1-10 scale with justification]
Impact if Wrong: [What happens if assumption is incorrect]
Validation Method: [How to test this assumption]
Update Frequency: [How often to re-validate]

Example:
Constraint: "Engineering team capacity"
Assumption: "Team can deliver 10 story points per sprint"
Source: "Historical velocity data from last 6 sprints"
Confidence Level: "8 - consistent recent data but team composition changing"
Impact if Wrong: "Project timeline delays, scope reduction needed"
Validation Method: "Track actual velocity, monitor team changes"
Update Frequency: "Monthly review with sprint retrospectives"
```

#### Historical Validation
- Analysis of past constraint behavior and violation patterns
- Comparison of assumed vs. actual constraint limits
- Pattern recognition for constraint evolution and change
- Case study analysis from similar environments and decisions

#### Real-time Validation
- Continuous monitoring of constraint status and changes
- Early warning systems for constraint violation risks
- Feedback loops from constraint testing and boundary pushing
- Expert consultation and stakeholder validation

### 5. Scenario Boundary Definition

**Use constraints to define realistic scenario limits:**

#### Feasible Scenario Space
```
Scenario Constraint Boundaries:

Optimistic Boundary:
- Best-case constraint relaxation (10-20% improvement)
- Favorable external conditions and support
- Maximum resource availability and efficiency
- Minimal constraint conflicts and trade-offs

Realistic Boundary:
- Expected constraint behavior and normal conditions
- Typical resource availability and standard efficiency
- Normal constraint conflicts requiring standard trade-offs
- Historical pattern-based constraint evolution

Pessimistic Boundary:
- Worst-case constraint tightening (10-20% degradation)
- Adverse external conditions and additional restrictions
- Reduced resource availability and efficiency challenges
- Maximum constraint conflicts requiring difficult trade-offs
```

#### Constraint Stress Testing
- Maximum constraint load scenarios and breaking points
- Cascade failure analysis when key constraints are violated
- Recovery scenarios and constraint restoration approaches
- Adaptive scenario adjustment for changing constraints

### 6. Dynamic Constraint Modeling

**Model how constraints change over time:**

#### Constraint Evolution Patterns
```
Temporal Constraint Dynamics:

Linear Evolution:
- Gradual constraint relaxation or tightening over time
- Predictable improvement or degradation patterns
- Resource accumulation or depletion trends
- Market maturation and capacity development

Cyclical Evolution:
- Seasonal constraint variations and patterns
- Economic cycle impacts on constraint severity
- Technology refresh cycles and capability updates
- Regulatory review cycles and compliance windows

Step Function Evolution:
- Sudden constraint changes from external events
- Technology breakthrough impacts on capability constraints
- Regulatory changes creating new constraint requirements
- Market disruptions changing competitive constraints

Threshold Evolution:
- Constraint regime changes at specific trigger points
- Scale-dependent constraint behavior modifications
- Maturity-based constraint relaxation or introduction
- Performance-based constraint adjustment mechanisms
```

#### Adaptive Constraint Management
- Constraint monitoring and early warning systems
- Proactive constraint modification and optimization
- Scenario adaptation for changing constraint conditions
- Strategic planning for anticipated constraint evolution

### 7. Constraint Optimization Strategies

**Generate approaches to work within and optimize constraints:**

#### Constraint Relaxation Approaches
```
Systematic Constraint Optimization:

Direct Relaxation:
- Negotiate constraint modifications with stakeholders
- Invest in capability building to reduce constraint impact
- Seek regulatory relief or compliance alternatives
- Restructure processes to minimize constraint conflicts

Constraint Substitution:
- Replace restrictive constraints with more flexible alternatives
- Trade hard constraints for soft constraints where possible
- Substitute resource constraints with efficiency improvements
- Replace time constraints with scope or quality adjustments

Constraint Circumvention:
- Design solutions that avoid constraint-heavy areas
- Use alternative approaches that minimize constraint impact
- Leverage partnerships to access capabilities beyond constraints
- Phase implementations to work within temporal constraints
```

#### Creative Constraint Solutions
- Constraint reframing and alternative perspective development
- Innovative approaches that turn constraints into advantages
- Synergistic solutions that address multiple constraints simultaneously
- Constraint-inspired innovation and creative problem solving

## Quality Indicators

- **Green**: Comprehensive constraint coverage, validated assumptions, dynamic modeling
- **Yellow**: Good constraint identification, some validation, basic change modeling
- **Red**: Limited constraint coverage, unvalidated assumptions, static modeling

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

- Constraint blindness: Not identifying hidden or implicit constraints
- Static thinking: Treating dynamic constraints as fixed limitations
- Over-constraint: Adding unnecessary restrictions that limit options
- Under-validation: Not testing constraint assumptions against reality
- Isolation thinking: Not modeling constraint interactions and dependencies
- Solution bias: Defining constraints to justify preferred solutions

Transform limitations into strategic clarity through systematic constraint modeling and optimization.
