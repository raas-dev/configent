# Add Mutation Testing

Setup mutation testing for code quality

## Instructions

1. **Mutation Testing Strategy Analysis**
   - Analyze current test suite coverage and quality
   - Identify critical code paths and business logic for mutation testing
   - Assess existing testing infrastructure and CI/CD integration points
   - Determine mutation testing scope and performance requirements
   - Plan mutation testing integration with existing quality gates

2. **Mutation Testing Tool Selection**
   - Choose appropriate mutation testing framework:
     - **JavaScript/TypeScript**: Stryker, Mutode
     - **Java**: PIT (Pitest), Major
     - **C#**: Stryker.NET, VisualMutator
     - **Python**: mutmut, Cosmic Ray, MutPy
     - **Go**: go-mutesting, mut
     - **Rust**: mutagen, cargo-mutants
     - **PHP**: Infection
   - Consider factors: language support, performance, CI integration, reporting

3. **Mutation Testing Configuration**
   - Install and configure mutation testing framework
   - Set up mutation testing configuration files and settings
   - Configure mutation operators and strategies
   - Set up file and directory inclusion/exclusion rules
   - Configure performance and timeout settings

4. **Mutation Operator Configuration**
   - Configure arithmetic operator mutations (+, -, *, /, %)
   - Set up relational operator mutations (<, >, <=, >=, ==, !=)
   - Configure logical operator mutations (&&, ||, !)
   - Set up conditional boundary mutations (< to <=, > to >=)
   - Configure statement deletion and insertion mutations

5. **Test Execution and Performance**
   - Configure mutation test execution strategy and parallelization
   - Set up incremental mutation testing for large codebases
   - Configure mutation testing timeouts and resource limits
   - Set up mutation test caching and optimization
   - Configure selective mutation testing for changed code

6. **Quality Metrics and Thresholds**
   - Set up mutation score calculation and reporting
   - Configure mutation testing thresholds and quality gates
   - Set up mutation survival analysis and reporting
   - Configure test effectiveness metrics and tracking
   - Set up mutation testing trend analysis

7. **Integration with Testing Workflow**
   - Integrate mutation testing with existing test suites
   - Configure mutation testing execution order and dependencies
   - Set up mutation testing in development and CI environments
   - Configure mutation testing result integration with test reports
   - Set up mutation testing feedback loops for developers

8. **CI/CD Pipeline Integration**
   - Configure automated mutation testing in continuous integration
   - Set up mutation testing scheduling and triggers
   - Configure mutation testing result reporting and notifications
   - Set up mutation testing performance monitoring
   - Configure mutation testing deployment gates

9. **Result Analysis and Remediation**
   - Set up mutation testing result analysis and visualization
   - Configure surviving mutant analysis and categorization
   - Set up test gap identification and remediation workflow
   - Configure mutation testing regression tracking
   - Set up automated test improvement recommendations

10. **Maintenance and Optimization**
    - Create mutation testing maintenance and optimization procedures
    - Set up mutation testing configuration version control
    - Configure mutation testing performance optimization
    - Document mutation testing best practices and guidelines
    - Train team on mutation testing concepts and workflow
    - Set up mutation testing tool updates and maintenance
