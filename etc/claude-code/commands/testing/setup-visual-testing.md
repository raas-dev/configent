# Setup Visual Testing

Setup visual regression testing

## Instructions

1. **Visual Testing Strategy Analysis**
   - Analyze current UI/component structure and testing needs
   - Identify critical user interfaces and visual components
   - Determine testing scope (components, pages, user flows)
   - Assess existing testing infrastructure and integration points
   - Plan visual testing coverage and baseline creation strategy

2. **Visual Testing Tool Selection**
   - Evaluate visual testing tools based on project requirements:
     - **Chromatic**: For Storybook integration and component testing
     - **Percy**: For comprehensive visual testing and CI integration
     - **Playwright**: For browser-based visual testing with built-in capabilities
     - **BackstopJS**: For lightweight visual regression testing
     - **Applitools**: For AI-powered visual testing and cross-browser support
   - Consider factors: budget, team size, CI/CD integration, browser support

3. **Visual Testing Framework Installation**
   - Install chosen visual testing tool and dependencies
   - Configure testing framework integration (Jest, Playwright, Cypress)
   - Set up browser automation and screenshot capabilities
   - Configure testing environment and viewport settings
   - Set up test runner and execution environment

4. **Baseline Creation and Management**
   - Create initial visual baselines for all critical UI components
   - Establish baseline approval workflow and review process
   - Set up baseline version control and storage
   - Configure baseline updates and maintenance procedures
   - Implement baseline branching strategy for feature development

5. **Test Configuration and Setup**
   - Configure visual testing parameters (viewports, browsers, devices)
   - Set up visual diff thresholds and sensitivity settings
   - Configure screenshot capture settings and optimization
   - Set up test data and state management for consistent testing
   - Configure async loading and timing handling

6. **Component and Page Testing**
   - Create visual tests for individual UI components
   - Set up page-level visual testing for critical user flows
   - Configure responsive design testing across different viewports
   - Implement cross-browser visual testing
   - Set up accessibility and color contrast visual validation

7. **CI/CD Pipeline Integration**
   - Configure automated visual testing in CI/CD pipeline
   - Set up visual test execution on pull requests
   - Configure test result reporting and notifications
   - Set up deployment blocking for failed visual tests
   - Implement parallel test execution for performance

8. **Review and Approval Workflow**
   - Set up visual diff review and approval process
   - Configure team notifications for visual changes
   - Establish approval authority and review guidelines
   - Set up automated approval for minor acceptable changes
   - Configure change documentation and tracking

9. **Monitoring and Maintenance**
   - Set up visual test performance monitoring
   - Configure test flakiness detection and resolution
   - Implement baseline cleanup and maintenance procedures
   - Set up visual testing metrics and reporting
   - Configure alerting for test failures and issues

10. **Documentation and Team Training**
    - Create comprehensive visual testing documentation
    - Document baseline creation and update procedures
    - Create troubleshooting guide for common visual testing issues
    - Train team on visual testing workflows and best practices
    - Set up visual testing standards and conventions
    - Document visual testing maintenance and optimization procedures
