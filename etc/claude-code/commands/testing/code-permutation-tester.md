- **Yellow**: Some variations tested, basic quality assessment, estimated performance
- **Red**: Single approach, minimal testing, unvalidated assumptions

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

- Premature optimization: Over-engineering for theoretical rather than real requirements
- Analysis paralysis: Testing too many variations without making decisions
- Context ignorance: Not considering real-world constraints and team capabilities
- Quality tunnel vision: Optimizing for single dimension while ignoring others
- Simulation disconnect: Testing scenarios that don't match production reality
- Decision delay: Not acting on simulation results in timely manner

Transform code implementation from guesswork into systematic, evidence-based decision making through comprehensive variation testing and simulation.
