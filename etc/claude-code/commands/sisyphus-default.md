description: Set Sisyphus as your default operating mode
---

I'll configure Sisyphus as your default operating mode by updating your CLAUDE.md.

$ARGUMENTS

## Enabling Sisyphus Default Mode

This will update your global CLAUDE.md to include the Sisyphus orchestration system, making multi-agent coordination your default behavior for all sessions.

### What This Enables
1. Automatic access to 11 specialized subagents
2. Multi-agent delegation capabilities via the Task tool
3. Continuation enforcement - tasks complete before stopping
4. Magic keyword support (ultrawork, search, analyze)

### To Revert
Remove or edit ~/.claude/CLAUDE.md

---

**Sisyphus is now your default mode.** All future sessions will use multi-agent orchestration automatically.

Use `/sisyphus <task>` to explicitly invoke orchestration mode, or just include "ultrawork" in your prompts.
