Analysis target: $ARGUMENTS

## Deep Analysis Instructions
- Thoroughly examine all relevant code paths
- Trace data flow from source to destination
- Identify edge cases and potential failure modes
- Check for related issues in similar code patterns
- Document findings with specific file:line references
- Propose concrete solutions with code examples
- Consider performance, security, and maintainability implications
