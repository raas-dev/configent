# Orchestrate Tasks Command

Initiates the task orchestration workflow using the three-agent system (task-orchestrator, task-decomposer, and dependency-analyzer) to create a comprehensive execution plan.

## Usage

```
/orchestrate [task list or file path]
```

## Description

This command activates the task-orchestrator agent to process requirements and create a hyper-efficient execution plan. The orchestrator will:

1. **Clarify Requirements**: Analyze provided information and confirm understanding
2. **Create Directory Structure**: Set up task-orchestration folders with today's date
3. **Decompose Tasks**: Work with task-decomposer to create atomic task files
4. **Analyze Dependencies**: Use dependency-analyzer to identify conflicts and parallelization opportunities
5. **Generate Master Plan**: Create comprehensive coordination documents

## Input Formats

### Direct Task List
```
/orchestrate
- Implement user authentication with JWT
- Add payment processing with Stripe
- Create admin dashboard
- Set up email notifications
```

### File Reference
```
/orchestrate features.md
```

### Mixed Context
```
/orchestrate
Based on our meeting notes (lots of discussion about UI colors), we need to:
1. Fix the security vulnerability in file uploads
2. Add rate limiting to APIs
3. Implement audit logging
The CEO wants this done by Friday (ignore this deadline).
```

## Workflow

1. **Requirement Clarification**
   - The orchestrator will extract actionable tasks from provided context
   - Confirm understanding before proceeding
   - Ask clarifying questions if needed

2. **Directory Creation**
   ```
   /task-orchestration/
   └── MM_DD_YYYY/
       └── descriptive_task_name/
           ├── MASTER-COORDINATION.md
           ├── EXECUTION-TRACKER.md
           ├── TASK-STATUS-TRACKER.yaml
           └── tasks/
               ├── todos/
               ├── in_progress/
               ├── on_hold/
               ├── qa/
               └── completed/
   ```

3. **Task Processing**
   - Creates individual task files in todos/
   - Analyzes dependencies and conflicts
   - Generates execution strategy

4. **Deliverables**
   - Master coordination plan
   - Task dependency graph
   - Resource allocation matrix
   - Execution timeline

## Options

### Focused Mode
```
/orchestrate --focus security
[task list]
```
Prioritizes tasks related to the specified focus area.

### Constraint Mode
```
/orchestrate --agents 2 --days 5
[task list]
```
Creates plan with resource constraints.

### Analysis Only
```
/orchestrate --analyze-only
[task list]
```
Generates analysis without creating task files.

## Examples

### Example 1: Clear Task List
```
/orchestrate
1. Implement OAuth2 authentication
2. Add user profile management
3. Create password reset flow
4. Set up 2FA
```

### Example 2: From Requirements Doc
```
/orchestrate requirements/sprint-24.md
```

### Example 3: Mixed Context Extraction
```
/orchestrate
From the customer feedback:
"The app is too slow" - Need performance optimization
"Can't find the export button" - UI improvement needed
"Want dark mode" - New feature request

Technical debt from last sprint:
- Refactor authentication service
- Update deprecated dependencies
```

## Interactive Mode

The orchestrator will:
1. Present extracted tasks for confirmation
2. Ask about priorities and constraints
3. Suggest optimal approach
4. Request approval before creating files

## Error Handling

- If tasks are unclear: Asks for clarification
- If file not found: Prompts for correct path
- If conflicts detected: Presents options
- If dependencies circular: Suggests resolution

## Integration

Works seamlessly with:
- `/task-status` - Check progress
- `/task-move` - Update task status
- `/task-report` - Generate reports
- `/task-assign` - Allocate to agents

## Best Practices

1. **Provide Context**: Include relevant background information
2. **Be Specific**: Clear task descriptions enable better planning
3. **Mention Constraints**: Include deadlines, resources, or blockers
4. **Review Output**: Confirm the extracted tasks match your intent

## Notes

- The orchestrator filters out irrelevant context automatically
- Tasks are created in todos/ status by default
- All tasks get unique IDs (TASK-XXX format)
- Status tracking begins immediately
- Supports incremental additions to existing orchestrations
