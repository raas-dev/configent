# Orchestration Log Command

Log work from orchestrated tasks to external project management tools like Linear, Obsidian, Jira, or GitHub Issues.

## Usage

```
/orchestration/log [TASK-ID] [options]
```

## Description

Automatically creates work logs in your connected project management tools or knowledge bases, transferring task completion data, time spent, and progress notes to keep external systems synchronized.

## Basic Commands

### Log Current Task
```
/orchestration/log
```
Logs the currently in-progress task to available tools.

### Log Specific Task
```
/orchestration/log TASK-003
```
Logs a specific task's work.

### Choose Destination
```
/orchestration/log TASK-003 --choose
```
Manually select where to log the work.

## Destination Selection

When multiple tools are available or no obvious connection exists:

```
Where would you like to log this work?

Available destinations:
1. Linear (ENG-1234 detected)
2. Obsidian (Daily Note)
3. Obsidian (Project: Authentication)
4. GitHub Issue (#123)
5. None - Skip logging

Choose destination [1-5]:
```

## Obsidian Integration

### Daily Note Logging
```
/orchestration/log --obsidian-daily
```
Appends to today's daily note:

### Project Note Logging
```
/orchestration/log --obsidian-project "Authentication System"
```
Creates or appends to project-specific note.

### Custom Obsidian Location

## Smart Detection

The system detects available destinations:

```
Analyzing task context...

Found connections:
âœ“ Linear: ENG-1234 (from branch name)
âœ“ Obsidian: Project note exists
âœ“ GitHub: No issue reference
âœ— Jira: Not connected

Suggested: Linear ENG-1234

## Examples

### Example 1: End of Day Logging
```
/orchestration/log --eod

End of Day Summary:
- 3 tasks worked on
- 7.5 hours logged
- 2 completed, 1 in progress

Log to:
1. Obsidian Daily Note (recommended)
2. Linear (update all 3 issues)
3. Both
4. Skip

Choice [1]: 1

âœ“ Daily work log created in Obsidian
```

### Example 2: Sprint Review
```
/orchestration/log --sprint-review --week 11

Gathering week 11 data...
- 15 tasks completed
- 3 in progress
- 52 hours logged

Create sprint review in:
1. Obsidian - "Sprint Reviews/Sprint 24"
2. Linear - Sprint 24 cycle
3. Both

Choice [3]: 3

âœ“ Sprint review created in both systems
```

### Example 3: No Connection Found
```
/orchestration/log TASK-009

No automatic destination found for TASK-009.

Where would you like to log this?
1. Obsidian - Daily Note
2. Obsidian - Create Project Note
3. Linear - Search for issue
4. GitHub - Create new issue
5. Skip logging

Choice: 2

Enter project name: Security Audit
âœ“ Created "Security Audit" note with work log
```

## Configuration

### Default Destinations
```yaml
log_defaults:
  no_connection: "ask"  # ask|obsidian-daily|skip
  multi_connection: "ask"  # ask|all|first

  obsidian:
    default_location: "daily"  # daily|project|custom
    project_folder: "Projects"
    daily_folder: "Daily Notes"

  linear:
    auto_update_status: true
    include_commits: true
```

## Best Practices

1. **Set Preferences**: Configure default destinations
2. **Link Early**: Connect tasks to PM tools when creating
3. **Use Daily Notes**: Great for personal tracking
4. **Project Notes**: Better for team collaboration
5. **Regular Syncs**: Don't let logs pile up

## Notes

- Respects MCP connections and permissions
- Obsidian logs create backlinks automatically
- Supports multiple simultaneous destinations
- Preserves formatting across systems
- Can be automated with task status changes
