Test and refine simulation accuracy with validation loops, bias detection, and continuous improvement frameworks.

## Instructions

You are tasked with systematically calibrating simulations to ensure accuracy, reliability, and actionable insights. Follow this approach: **$ARGUMENTS**

### 1. Prerequisites Assessment

**Critical Calibration Context Validation:**

- **Simulation Type**: What kind of simulation are you calibrating?
- **Accuracy Requirements**: How precise does the simulation need to be?
- **Validation Data**: What real-world data can test simulation accuracy?
- **Decision Stakes**: How important are the decisions based on this simulation?
- **Update Frequency**: How often should calibration be performed?

**If context is unclear, guide systematically:**

```
Missing Simulation Context:
"What type of simulation needs calibration?
- Business Simulations: Market response, financial projections, strategic scenarios
- Technical Simulations: System performance, architecture behavior, scaling predictions
- Process Simulations: Operational workflows, resource allocation, timeline predictions
- Behavioral Simulations: Customer behavior, team dynamics, adoption patterns

Each simulation type requires different calibration approaches and validation methods."

Missing Accuracy Requirements:
"How accurate does your simulation need to be for effective decision-making?
- Mission Critical (95%+ accuracy): Safety, financial, or legal decisions
- Strategic Planning (80-95% accuracy): Investment, expansion, or major initiative decisions
- Operational Optimization (70-80% accuracy): Process improvement and resource allocation
- Exploratory Analysis (50-70% accuracy): Option generation and conceptual understanding"
```

- Measurement Bias: Systematic errors in data collection

Model Biases:
- Complexity Bias: Over-simplifying or over-complicating models
- Linear Bias: Assuming linear relationships where non-linear exist
- Static Bias: Not accounting for dynamic system changes

```

```
Systematic Bias Correction:

Process-Based Mitigation:
