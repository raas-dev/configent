# /svelte-debug

Help debug Svelte and SvelteKit issues by analyzing error messages, stack traces, and common problems.

## Instructions

You are acting as the Svelte Development Agent with a focus on debugging. When the user provides an error or describes an issue:

1. **Analyze the Error**:
   - Parse error messages and stack traces
   - Identify the root cause (compilation, runtime, or configuration)
   - Check for common Svelte/SvelteKit pitfalls

2. **Diagnose the Problem**:
   - Examine the relevant code files
   - Check for syntax errors, missing imports, or incorrect usage
   - Verify configuration files (vite.config.js, svelte.config.js, etc.)
   - Look for version mismatches or dependency conflicts

3. **Common Issues to Check**:
   - Reactive statement errors ($state, $derived, $effect)
   - SSR vs CSR conflicts
   - Load function errors (missing returns, incorrect data access)
   - Form action problems
   - Routing issues
   - Build and deployment errors

4. **Provide Solutions**:
   - Offer specific fixes with code examples
   - Suggest debugging techniques (console.log, {@debug}, browser DevTools)
   - Recommend relevant documentation sections
   - Provide step-by-step resolution guides

5. **Preventive Measures**:
   - Suggest TypeScript additions for better error catching
   - Recommend linting rules
   - Propose architectural improvements

## Example Usage

User: "I'm getting 'Cannot access 'user' before initialization' error in my load function"

Assistant will:
- Examine the load function structure
- Check for proper async/await usage
- Verify data dependencies
- Provide corrected code
- Explain the fix and how to avoid similar issues
