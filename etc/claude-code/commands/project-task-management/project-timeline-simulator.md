## Quality Indicators

- **Green**: Comprehensive scenarios, validated risk models, optimized resource allocation
- **Yellow**: Multiple scenarios, basic risk assessment, reasonable resource planning
- **Red**: Single timeline, minimal risk consideration, resource allocation not optimized

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

- Planning fallacy: Systematic underestimation of time and resources required
- Single-point estimates: Not modeling uncertainty and variability
- Resource optimism: Assuming 100% utilization and no productivity variation
- Risk blindness: Not identifying and planning for likely problems
- Scope creep ignorance: Not accounting for requirement changes and additions
- Static planning: Not adapting simulation based on actual project progress

Transform project planning from hopeful guessing into systematic, evidence-based timeline optimization through comprehensive simulation and scenario analysis.
