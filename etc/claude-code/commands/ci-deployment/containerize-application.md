# Containerize Application

Containerize application for deployment

## Instructions

1. **Application Analysis and Containerization Strategy**
   - Analyze application architecture and runtime requirements
   - Identify application dependencies and external services
   - Determine optimal base image and runtime environment
   - Plan multi-stage build strategy for optimization
   - Assess security requirements and compliance needs

2. **Dockerfile Creation and Optimization**
   - Create comprehensive Dockerfile with multi-stage builds
   - Select minimal base images (Alpine, distroless, or slim variants)
   - Configure proper layer caching and build optimization
   - Implement security best practices (non-root user, minimal attack surface)
   - Set up proper file permissions and ownership

3. **Build Process Configuration**
   - Configure .dockerignore file to exclude unnecessary files
   - Set up build arguments and environment variables
   - Implement build-time dependency installation and cleanup
   - Configure application bundling and asset optimization
   - Set up proper build context and file structure

4. **Runtime Configuration**
   - Configure application startup and health checks
   - Set up proper signal handling and graceful shutdown
   - Configure logging and output redirection
   - Set up environment-specific configuration management
   - Configure resource limits and performance tuning

5. **Security Hardening**
   - Run application as non-root user with minimal privileges
   - Configure security scanning and vulnerability assessment
   - Implement secrets management and secure credential handling
   - Set up network security and firewall rules
   - Configure security policies and access controls

6. **Docker Compose Configuration**
   - Create docker-compose.yml for local development
   - Configure service dependencies and networking
   - Set up volume mounting and data persistence
   - Configure environment variables and secrets
   - Set up development vs production configurations

7. **Container Orchestration Preparation**
   - Prepare configurations for Kubernetes deployment
   - Create deployment manifests and service definitions
   - Configure ingress and load balancing
   - Set up persistent volumes and storage classes
   - Configure auto-scaling and resource management

8. **Monitoring and Observability**
   - Configure application metrics and health endpoints
   - Set up logging aggregation and centralized logging
   - Configure distributed tracing and monitoring
   - Set up alerting and notification systems
   - Configure performance monitoring and profiling

9. **CI/CD Integration**
   - Configure automated Docker image building
   - Set up image scanning and security validation
   - Configure image registry and artifact management
   - Set up automated deployment pipelines
   - Configure rollback and blue-green deployment strategies

10. **Testing and Validation**
    - Test container builds and functionality
    - Validate security configurations and compliance
    - Test deployment in different environments
    - Validate performance and resource utilization
    - Test backup and disaster recovery procedures
    - Create documentation for container deployment and management
