[PLAN REVIEW MODE]

$ARGUMENTS

## Plan Review with Momus

I will critically evaluate the specified plan using Momus, the ruthless plan reviewer.

### Evaluation Criteria
- **Clarity**: 80%+ of claims must cite specific file/line references
- **Testability**: 90%+ of acceptance criteria must be concrete and testable
- **Verification**: All file references must be verified to exist
- **Specificity**: No vague terms like "improve", "optimize" without metrics

### Output Format
- **APPROVED** - Plan meets all criteria, ready for execution
- **REVISE** - Plan has issues that need to be addressed (with specific feedback)
- **REJECT** - Plan has fundamental problems requiring replanning

### Usage
```
/review .sisyphus/plans/my-feature.md
/review  # Review the most recent plan
```

### What Gets Checked
1. Are requirements clear and unambiguous?
2. Are acceptance criteria concrete and testable?
3. Do file references actually exist?
4. Are implementation steps specific and actionable?
5. Are risks identified with mitigations?
6. Are verification steps defined?

Provide a plan file path to review, or I'll review the most recent plan in `.sisyphus/plans/`.
