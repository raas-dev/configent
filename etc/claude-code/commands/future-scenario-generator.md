# Future Scenario Generator

Generate and analyze future scenarios with plausibility scoring, trend integration, and uncertainty quantification.

## Instructions

You are tasked with systematically generating comprehensive future scenarios to explore potential developments and prepare for multiple possible futures. Follow this approach: **$ARGUMENTS**

### 1. Prerequisites Assessment

**Critical Scenario Context Validation:**

- **Time Horizon**: What future timeframe are you exploring (1-3-5-10+ years)?
- **Domain Focus**: What specific area/industry/system are you analyzing?
- **Key Variables**: What factors could significantly shape the future?
- **Decision Impact**: How will these scenarios inform specific decisions?
- **Uncertainty Level**: What's the acceptable range of scenario uncertainty?

**If context is unclear, guide systematically:**

```
Missing Time Horizon:
"What future timeframe should we explore?
- Near-term (1-2 years): Market shifts, competitive moves, technology adoption
- Medium-term (3-5 years): Industry transformation, regulatory changes, generational shifts
- Long-term (5-10+ years): Fundamental technology disruption, societal changes, paradigm shifts

Each timeframe requires different scenario methodologies and uncertainty management."

Missing Domain Focus:
"What specific domain or system should we model future scenarios for?
- Business/Industry: Market evolution, competitive landscape, customer behavior
- Technology: Platform shifts, capability development, adoption patterns
- Society/Culture: Demographic changes, value shifts, behavior evolution

- Stakeholder input and perspective integration
- Professional judgment and experience-based validation

Empirical Support (25% weight):
- Current data and trend evidence supporting scenario elements
- Quantitative model outputs and statistical projections
- Research findings and academic literature support

Plausibility Score = (Historical × 0.25) + (Logical × 0.25) + (Expert × 0.25) + (Empirical × 0.25)
```

#### Uncertainty Quantification
- Confidence intervals for key scenario parameters
- Sensitivity analysis for critical assumptions
- Monte Carlo simulation for probability distributions
- Expert elicitation for subjective probability assessment

### 5. Wild Card and Disruption Modeling

**Incorporate low-probability, high-impact events:**

#### Wild Card Event Framework
```
Systematic Disruption Analysis:

- Currency and monetary system transformations
- Trade pattern disruptions and economic bloc changes

Environmental/Political Wild Cards:
- Climate change acceleration or mitigation breakthroughs
- Geopolitical shifts and international relation changes
- Natural disasters and pandemic impacts
- Regulatory surprises and policy paradigm shifts
```

#### Disruption Impact Modeling

## Quality Indicators

- **Green**: Diverse scenario portfolio, validated plausibility scores, integrated wild cards
- **Yellow**: Good scenario variety, reasonable plausibility assessment, some disruption modeling
- **Red**: Limited scenario diversity, unvalidated assumptions, missing disruption analysis

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

- Present bias: Projecting current conditions too strongly into the future
- Linear thinking: Assuming trends continue unchanged without acceleration or disruption
- Probability illusion: Being overconfident in specific scenario likelihoods
- Complexity underestimation: Not modeling interaction effects between trends
- Wild card blindness: Ignoring low-probability, high-impact events
- Action paralysis: Generating scenarios without connecting to decisions

Transform uncertainty into strategic advantage through systematic future scenario exploration and preparation.
