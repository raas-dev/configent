# Meta & Orchestration Subagents

Meta & Orchestration subagents are your conductors and coordinators, managing complex multi-agent workflows and optimizing AI system performance. These specialists excel at the meta-level - orchestrating other agents, managing context, distributing tasks, and ensuring smooth collaboration between multiple AI systems. They turn chaos into symphony, making complex AI systems work harmoniously together.

## <¯ When to Use Meta & Orchestration Subagents

Use these subagents when you need to:
- **Coordinate multiple agents** for complex tasks
- **Optimize context usage** across conversations
- **Distribute tasks** efficiently among specialists
- **Handle errors** gracefully in multi-agent systems
- **Synthesize knowledge** from various sources
- **Monitor performance** of AI workflows
- **Design complex workflows** with multiple steps
- **Scale AI operations** across teams

## =Ë Available Subagents

### [**agent-organizer**](agent-organizer.md) - Multi-agent coordinator
Orchestration expert managing complex multi-agent collaborations. Masters task decomposition, agent selection, and result synthesis. Turns complex problems into coordinated solutions.

**Use when:** Coordinating multiple agents, breaking down complex tasks, managing agent dependencies, synthesizing results, or designing agent workflows.

### [**context-manager**](context-manager.md) - Context optimization expert
Context specialist maximizing efficiency in AI conversations. Expert in context windows, information prioritization, and memory management. Ensures optimal use of limited context space.

**Use when:** Optimizing long conversations, managing context windows, prioritizing information, implementing memory systems, or handling context overflow.

### [**error-coordinator**](error-coordinator.md) - Error handling and recovery specialist
Error handling expert ensuring graceful failure recovery. Masters error patterns, fallback strategies, and system resilience. Keeps multi-agent systems running smoothly despite failures.

**Use when:** Implementing error handling, designing recovery strategies, managing cascading failures, monitoring system health, or building resilient workflows.

### [**it-ops-orchestrator**](it-ops-orchestrator.md) - IT operations meta-orchestrator for PowerShell/.NET ecosystems
Meta-orchestrator that routes ambiguous infrastructure and operations tasks to the right specialist agents, with a strong preference for PowerShell and .NET-based workflows. Understands the roles of Windows infra, Azure, M365, and PowerShell language experts, and coordinates them to deliver end-to-end solutions.

**Use when:** A task smells like IT operations or infrastructure automation but spans multiple areas (AD, DNS/DHCP, Azure, M365, PowerShell modules). This orchestrator chooses and coordinates the best subagents (e.g., windows-infra-admin, azure-infra-engineer, m365-admin, powershell-5.1-expert, powershell-7-expert, powershell-module-architect) with PowerShell as the default implementation language.

### [**knowledge-synthesizer**](knowledge-synthesizer.md) - Knowledge aggregation expert
Knowledge synthesis specialist combining information from multiple sources. Expert in information fusion, conflict resolution, and insight generation. Creates coherent knowledge from diverse inputs.

**Use when:** Combining multiple perspectives, resolving conflicting information, generating comprehensive reports, building knowledge bases, or synthesizing research.

### [**multi-agent-coordinator**](multi-agent-coordinator.md) - Advanced multi-agent orchestration
Advanced orchestration expert handling complex agent ecosystems. Masters parallel processing, dependency management, and distributed workflows. Scales AI operations to enterprise level.

**Use when:** Building large-scale agent systems, implementing parallel workflows, managing agent ecosystems, coordinating distributed tasks, or optimizing throughput.

### [**performance-monitor**](performance-monitor.md) - Agent performance optimization
Performance specialist monitoring and optimizing agent systems. Expert in metrics, bottleneck analysis, and optimization strategies. Ensures peak performance across all agents.

**Use when:** Monitoring agent performance, identifying bottlenecks, optimizing workflows, implementing metrics, or improving system efficiency.

### [**task-distributor**](task-distributor.md) - Task allocation specialist
Task distribution expert optimizing work allocation across agents. Masters load balancing, capability matching, and priority scheduling. Ensures efficient use of all available agents.

**Use when:** Distributing tasks among agents, implementing load balancing, optimizing task queues, managing priorities, or scheduling agent work.

### [**workflow-orchestrator**](workflow-orchestrator.md) - Complex workflow automation
Workflow specialist designing and executing sophisticated AI workflows. Expert in workflow patterns, state management, and process automation. Transforms complex processes into smooth operations.

**Use when:** Designing complex workflows, implementing process automation, managing workflow state, handling long-running processes, or building workflow engines.
