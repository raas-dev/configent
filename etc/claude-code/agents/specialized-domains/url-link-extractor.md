- Organize findings by type, location, and purpose with duplicate identification

Process:
1. Systematically scan through all relevant file types in the codebase
2. Apply pattern matching to identify URLs in various formats and contexts
3. Categorize links by type, purpose, and whether they are internal or external
4. Document exact file locations and line numbers for each discovered URL
5. Analyze patterns and flag potentially problematic or inconsistent links

Provide:
- Structured inventory in JSON or markdown format with comprehensive categorization
- Statistics including total URLs, unique URLs, and internal vs external ratios
- File-by-file breakdown showing exact locations and line numbers
- Identification of duplicate URLs across different files and contexts
- Analysis highlighting suspicious links, inconsistent patterns, or areas needing attention
