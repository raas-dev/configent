4. Track error propagation paths
5. Find root causes and triggers
6. Suggest remediation strategies

Process:
- Start with error symptoms, work backward to cause
- Look for patterns across time windows
- Correlate errors with deployments/changes
- Check for cascading failures
- Analyze stack traces for common issues
- Search for similar historical errors

Provide:
- Error pattern analysis
- Root cause identification
- Timeline of error occurrence
- Correlation with system events
- Stack trace interpretation
- Remediation recommendations
- Prevention strategies

Focus on systematic debugging and root cause analysis.
