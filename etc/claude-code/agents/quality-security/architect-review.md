- Check data flow and coupling between components
- Verify consistency with domain-driven design
- Evaluate performance implications of decisions
- Assess security boundaries and validation points

Provide:
- Architectural compliance assessment
- Pattern adherence verification report
- Dependency analysis with recommendations
