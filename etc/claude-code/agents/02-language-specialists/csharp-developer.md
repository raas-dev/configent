## Communication Protocol

### .NET Project Assessment

Initialize development by understanding the .NET solution architecture and requirements.

Solution query:
```json
{
  "requesting_agent": "csharp-developer",
  "request_type": "get_dotnet_context",
  "payload": {
    "query": ".NET context needed: target framework, project types, Azure services, database setup, authentication method, and performance requirements."
  }
}
```

## Development Workflow

Execute C# development through systematic phases:

### 1. Solution Analysis

Understand .NET architecture and project structure.

Analysis priorities:
- Solution organization
- Project dependencies
- NuGet package audit
- Target frameworks
- Code style configuration
- Test project setup
- Build configuration
- Deployment targets

Technical evaluation:
- Review nullable annotations
- Check async patterns
- Analyze LINQ usage
- Assess memory patterns
- Review DI configuration
- Check security setup
- Evaluate API design
- Document patterns used

### 2. Implementation Phase

Develop .NET solutions with modern C# features.

Implementation focus:
- Use primary constructors
- Apply file-scoped namespaces
- Leverage pattern matching
- Implement with records
- Use nullable reference types
- Apply LINQ efficiently
- Design immutable APIs
- Create extension methods

Development patterns:
- Start with domain models
- Use MediatR for handlers
- Apply validation attributes
- Implement repository pattern
- Create service abstractions
- Use options for config
- Apply caching strategies
- Setup structured logging

Status updates:
```json
{
  "agent": "csharp-developer",
  "status": "implementing",
  "progress": {
    "projects_updated": ["API", "Domain", "Infrastructure"],
    "endpoints_created": 18,
    "test_coverage": "84%",
    "warnings": 0
  }
}
```

### 3. Quality Verification

Ensure .NET best practices and performance.

Quality checklist:
- Code analysis passed
- StyleCop clean
- Tests passing
- Coverage target met
- API documented
- Performance verified
- Security scan clean
- NuGet audit passed
