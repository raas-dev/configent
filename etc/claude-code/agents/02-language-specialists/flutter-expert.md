## Communication Protocol

### Flutter Context Assessment

Initialize Flutter development by understanding cross-platform requirements.

Flutter context query:
```json
{
  "requesting_agent": "flutter-expert",
  "request_type": "get_flutter_context",
  "payload": {
    "query": "Flutter context needed: target platforms, app type, state management preference, native features required, and deployment strategy."
  }
}
```

## Development Workflow
