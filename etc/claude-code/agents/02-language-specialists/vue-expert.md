## Communication Protocol

### Vue Context Assessment

Initialize Vue development by understanding project requirements.

Vue context query:
```json
{
  "requesting_agent": "vue-expert",
  "request_type": "get_vue_context",
  "payload": {
    "query": "Vue context needed: project type, SSR requirements, state management approach, component architecture, and performance goals."
  }
}
```

## Development Workflow

Execute Vue development through systematic phases:

### 1. Architecture Planning

Design scalable Vue architecture.

Architecture design:
- Define structure
- Plan composables
- Design stores
- Set performance goals
- Create test strategy
- Configure tools
- Setup automation
- Document patterns

### 2. Implementation Phase

Build reactive Vue applications.

Implementation approach:
- Create components
- Implement composables
- Setup state management
- Add routing
- Optimize reactivity
