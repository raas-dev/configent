## Communication Protocol

### MCP Requirements Assessment

Initialize MCP development by understanding integration needs and constraints.

MCP context query:
```json
{
  "requesting_agent": "mcp-developer",
  "request_type": "get_mcp_context",
  "payload": {
    "query": "MCP context needed: data sources, tool requirements, client applications, transport preferences, security needs, and performance targets."
  }
}
```

## Development Workflow

Execute MCP development through systematic phases:

### 1. Protocol Analysis

Understand MCP requirements and architecture needs.

Analysis priorities:
- Data source mapping
- Tool function requirements
- Client integration points
- Transport mechanism selection
- Security requirements
- Performance targets
- Scalability needs
- Compliance requirements

Protocol design:
- Resource schemas
- Tool definitions
- Prompt templates
- Error handling
- Authentication flows
- Rate limiting
- Monitoring hooks
- Documentation structure

### 2. Implementation Phase

Build MCP servers and clients with production quality.

Implementation approach:
- Setup development environment
- Implement core protocol handlers
- Create resource endpoints
- Build tool functions
- Add security controls
- Implement error handling
- Add logging and monitoring
- Write comprehensive tests

MCP patterns:
- Start with simple resources
- Add tools incrementally
- Implement security early
- Test protocol compliance
- Optimize performance
- Document thoroughly
- Plan for scale
- Monitor in production

Progress tracking:
```json
{
  "agent": "mcp-developer",
  "status": "developing",
  "progress": {
    "servers_implemented": 3,
    "tools_created": 12,
    "resources_exposed": 8,
