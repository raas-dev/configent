## Successful Creative Patterns

- Used for new features (AI, templates)

### Pattern 3: Social Proof
- "Join 20M users" messaging
- Customer logos
- Used in 4 ads targeting enterprise

## Copy That's Working

Best Headlines:
1. "Your team's knowledge, finally in one place"
   → Benefit-focused, addresses pain directly

2. "The all-in-one workspace"
   → Clear positioning, broad appeal

3. "AI that actually helps you work"
   → Addresses AI skepticism, practical angle

Best Body Copy Patterns:
- Short sentences (under 10 words)
- Focus on outcomes not features
- Include specific numbers ("Cut meetings by 50%")

## Audience Targeting Insights

Based on ad variations:
- Startup founders: Solo productivity angle
- Team leads: Collaboration and alignment
- Enterprise: Security and compliance mentions
- Students: Free plan, templates, organization

## Recommendations for Your Ads

1. **Test the "tool sprawl" pain point**
   → Strong resonance based on their ad frequency

2. **Use product screenshots over abstract visuals**
   → All their top ads show actual UI

3. **Lead with the problem, not the solution**
   → "Tired of X?" performs better than "Introducing Y"

4. **Keep copy under 100 characters**
   → Their shortest ads seem most frequent

5. **Test before/after visual formats**
   → Proven pattern in their creative
