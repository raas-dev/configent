   Added to outline under Section 2.
   ```

4. **Improve Hooks**

   When user shares an introduction, analyze and strengthen:

   **Current Hook Analysis**:
   - What works: [positive elements]
   - What could be stronger: [areas for improvement]
   - Emotional impact: [current vs. potential]

   **Suggested Alternatives**:

   Option 1: [Bold statement]
   > [Example]
   *Why it works: [explanation]*

   > [Example]
   *Why it works: [explanation]*

   Option 3: [Surprising data]
   > [Example]
   *Why it works: [explanation]*

   **Questions to hook**:
   - Does it create curiosity?

6. **Preserve Writer's Voice**

   Important principles:

   - **Learn their style**: Read existing writing samples
   - **Suggest, don't replace**: Offer options, not directives
   - **Match tone**: Formal, casual, technical, friendly
   - **Respect choices**: If they prefer their version, support it
   - **Enhance, don't override**: Make their writing better, not different

   Ask periodically:
   - "Does this sound like you?"
   - "Is this the right tone?"
   - "Should I be more/less [formal/casual/technical]?"

7. **Citation Management**

   Handle references based on user preference:

   **Inline Citations**:
   ```markdown
   Studies show 40% productivity improvement (McKinsey, 2024).
   ```

   **Numbered References**:
   ```markdown
   Studies show 40% productivity improvement [1].

   [1] McKinsey Global Institute. (2024)...
   ```

   **Footnote Style**:
   ```markdown
   Studies show 40% productivity improvement^1

   ^1: McKinsey Global Institute. (2024)...
   ```

   Maintain a running citations list:
   ```markdown
   ## References

   1. Author. (Year). "Title". Publication.
   2. Author. (Year). "Title". Publication.

## Examples

### Example 1: Teresa Torres's Workflow

**User**: "I'm writing an article about continuous discovery. Help me create an outline."

**Process**:
1. Collaborates on outline structure
2. Identifies research needs
3. User starts writing introduction
4. Reviews and improves the hook
5. User writes each section
6. Provides feedback after each section
7. Conducts research and adds citations
8. Final review of complete draft
9. Polish and prep for publishing

**Result**: Well-researched, properly cited article written in Teresa's voice with strong structure and flow.

### Example 2: Research-Heavy Article

**User**: "I'm writing about AI's impact on product management. Help me find current data and examples."

**Output**:
```markdown
## Research Compiled

### Recent Data
- Gartner: 80% of PMs will use AI tools by 2025 [1]
- Survey: 45% report faster feature shipping [2]
- Case study: Airbnb's AI-assisted prioritization [3]

### Expert Quotes
- "AI amplifies PM judgment, not replaces it" - Marty Cagan
- [Additional quotes with citations]

### Real Examples
1. **Company A**: Used AI for user research synthesis
   - Result: 60% time savings
   - Source: [citation]

2. **Company B**: AI-powered roadmap analysis
   - Result: Better stakeholder alignment
   - Source: [citation]

All added to your outline with proper citations.
```

### Example 3: Hook Improvement

**User's Original Hook**:
> "Product management is changing because of AI. In this article, I'll discuss some ways AI affects product managers."

**Improved Options**:

**Option 1 (Data-driven)**:
> "Last month, I asked AI to analyze 500 customer interviews. It took 30 minutes instead of 3 weeks. Product management will never be the same."

**Option 2 (Question)**:
> "What if you could talk to every customer, read every review, and analyze every support ticketâ€”all before your morning coffee?"

**Option 3 (Story)**:
> "Sarah spent two weeks building the wrong feature. Not because she didn't understand her users, but because she couldn't process the hundreds of interviews fast enough to spot the pattern."

### Example 4: Section Feedback

**User**: "Just finished my 'Common Mistakes' section. Thoughts?"

**Response**:
```markdown
# Feedback: Common Mistakes Section

## What Works Well âœ“
- Strong examples (the Slack notification story)
- Clear structure (3 mistakes, clean layout)
- Practical advice for each mistake

## Suggestions

### Make It More Specific
Your second point says "Bad prioritization" but could be stronger:

Current:
> "Many teams prioritize badly by focusing on features instead of outcomes."

Suggested:
> "I've watched teams ship 14 features in a quarter yet move none of their key metrics. They prioritized activity over progress."

### Add Data
The third mistake would benefit from evidence:
> "[Add citation]: Studies show teams without regular user contact are 3x more likely to build unused features [needs source]"

### Flow Improvement
Consider reordering: Mistake 3 â†’ Mistake 2 â†’ Mistake 1
This builds from small to big impact.
