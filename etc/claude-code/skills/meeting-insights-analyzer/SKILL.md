- Identifying when you avoid difficult conversations
- Understanding your speaking habits and filler words
- Tracking improvement in communication skills over time
- Preparing for performance reviews with concrete examples
- Coaching team members on their communication style

## What This Skill Does

1. **Pattern Recognition**: Identifies recurring behaviors across meetings like:
   - Conflict avoidance or indirect communication
   - Speaking ratios and turn-taking
   - Question-asking vs. statement-making patterns
   - Active listening indicators
   - Decision-making approaches

2. **Communication Analysis**: Evaluates communication effectiveness:
   - Clarity and directness
   - Use of filler words and hedging language
   - Tone and sentiment patterns
   - Meeting control and facilitation

3. **Actionable Feedback**: Provides specific, timestamped examples with:
   - What happened
   - Why it matters
   - How to improve

4. **Trend Tracking**: Compares patterns over time when analyzing multiple meetings

## How to Use

### Basic Setup

1. Download your meeting transcripts to a folder (e.g., `~/meetings/`)
2. Navigate to that folder in Claude Code
3. Ask for the analysis you want

### Quick Start Examples

```
Analyze all meetings in this folder and tell me when I avoided conflict.
```

```
Look at my meetings from the past month and identify my communication patterns.
```

```
Compare my facilitation style between these two meeting folders.
```

### Advanced Analysis

```
Analyze all transcripts in this folder and:
1. Identify when I interrupted others
2. Calculate my speaking ratio
3. Find moments I avoided giving direct feedback
4. Track my use of filler words
5. Show examples of good active listening
```

## Instructions

When a user requests meeting analysis:

1. **Discover Available Data**
   - Scan the folder for transcript files (.txt, .md, .vtt, .srt, .docx)
   - Check if files contain speaker labels and timestamps
   - Confirm the date range of meetings
   - Identify the user's name/identifier in transcripts

2. **Clarify Analysis Goals**

   If not specified, ask what they want to learn:
   - Specific behaviors (conflict avoidance, interruptions, filler words)
   - Communication effectiveness (clarity, directness, listening)
   - Meeting facilitation skills
   - Speaking patterns and ratios
   - Growth areas for improvement

3. **Analyze Patterns**

   For each requested insight:

   **Conflict Avoidance**:
   - Look for hedging language ("maybe", "kind of", "I think")
   - Indirect phrasing instead of direct requests
   - Changing subject when tension arises
   - Agreeing without commitment ("yeah, but...")
   - Not addressing obvious problems

   **Speaking Ratios**:
   - Calculate percentage of meeting spent speaking
   - Count interruptions (by and of the user)
   - Measure average speaking turn length
   - Track question vs. statement ratios

   **Filler Words**:
   - Count "um", "uh", "like", "you know", "actually", etc.
   - Note frequency per minute or per speaking turn
   - Identify situations where they increase (nervous, uncertain)

   **Active Listening**:
   - Questions that reference others' previous points
   - Paraphrasing or summarizing others' ideas
   - Building on others' contributions
   - Asking clarifying questions

   **Leadership & Facilitation**:
   - Decision-making approach (directive vs. collaborative)
   - How disagreements are handled
   - Inclusion of quieter participants
   - Time management and agenda control
   - Follow-up and action item clarity

4. **Provide Specific Examples**

   For each pattern found, include:

   ```markdown
   ### [Pattern Name]

   **Finding**: [One-sentence summary of the pattern]

   **Frequency**: [X times across Y meetings]

   **Examples**:

      [Explanation of the impact or missed opportunity]

      **Better Approach**:
      [Specific alternative phrasing or behavior]

   [Repeat for 2-3 strongest examples]
   ```

5. **Synthesize Insights**

   After analyzing all patterns, provide:

   ```markdown
   # Meeting Insights Summary

   **Analysis Period**: [Date range]
   **Meetings Analyzed**: [X meetings]
   **Total Duration**: [X hours]

   - Create a personal communication development plan
   - Generate a summary for performance reviews

## Examples

### Example 1: Conflict Avoidance Analysis (Inspired by Dan Shipper)

**User**: "I download all of my meeting recordings and put them in a folder. Tell me all the times I've subtly avoided conflict."

**Output**:
```markdown
# Conflict Avoidance Patterns

Found 23 instances across 15 meetings where you used indirect
communication or avoided addressing tensions directly.

## Pattern: Hedging on Critical Feedback

**Frequency**: 8 times across 7 meetings

**Example 1: 1:1 with Sarah** - 00:14:32

**What Happened**:
> "So, I was thinking... maybe we could, like, potentially
> consider looking at the timeline again? I mean, if you
> think that makes sense. But whatever you think is best!"

**Why This Matters**:
You needed to address that Sarah's project was behind schedule,
but the hedging language ("maybe", "potentially", "if you think")
and the deflection at the end ("whatever you think") made it easy
for her to miss the urgency.

**Better Approach**:
"Sarah, the project is two weeks behind schedule. We need to
discuss what's blocking progress and create a new timeline
today."

## Recommendations

1. **Name the issue directly** in the first sentence
2. **Remove hedging words** like "maybe," "kind of," "sort of"
3. **Ask specific questions** instead of hinting
4. **Schedule difficult conversations** instead of raising them casually
```

### Example 2: Leadership Facilitation

**User**: "Analyze my team meetings and tell me about my facilitation style."

**Output**: Provides insights on:
- How much you speak vs. team members (60% vs. 40%)
- Whether you ask questions or make statements (3:1 ratio)
- How you handle disagreements (tendency to resolve too quickly)
- Who speaks least and whether you draw them in
- Examples of good and missed facilitation moments

### Example 3: Personal Development Tracking

**User**: "Compare my meetings from Q1 vs. Q2 to see if I've improved my listening skills."

**Output**: Creates a comparative analysis showing:
- Decrease in interruptions (8 per meeting → 3 per meeting)
- Increase in clarifying questions (2 → 7 per meeting)
- Improvement in building on others' ideas
- Specific examples showing the difference
- Remaining areas for growth
