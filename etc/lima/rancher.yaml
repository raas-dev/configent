# It can be accessed from the host by exporting the kubeconfig file;
# the ports are already forwarded automatically by lima:
#
# $ export KUBECONFIG="$HOME/.lima/rancher/kubeconfig.yaml"
# $ limactl shell rancher sudo cat /etc/rancher/k3s/k3s.yaml > $KUBECONFIG
# $ kubectl get nodes

    The k3s kubeconfig file has not yet been created.
    Run "limactl shell k3s sudo journalctl -u k3s" to check the log.
    If that is still empty, check the bottom of the log at "/var/log/cloud-init-output.log".
