description: >
  Architecture audit that maps module dependencies, checks layering integrity, and
  flags structural decay across a codebase, drawing on twelve classic engineering books.
  Triggers when: user asks to audit architecture, review folder/module structure,
  check for circular imports, understand how the codebase is organized, or asks
  "does this follow clean architecture?" or "why does everything depend on everything?".
  Also triggers for onboarding requests: "explain this codebase to a new developer"
  or "give me a codebase tour" (use onboarding mode).
  Do NOT trigger for: PR-level code review (use brooks-review) or line-level refactoring
  questions — this skill analyzes structural/module-level concerns, not individual functions.

# Brooks-Lint — Architecture Audit

## Setup

1. Read `../_shared/common.md` for the Iron Law, Project Config, Report Template, and Health Score rules
2. Read `../_shared/source-coverage.md` for book-level coverage, exceptions, and tradeoffs
3. Read `../_shared/decay-risks.md` for symptom definitions and source attributions
4. Read `architecture-guide.md` in this directory for the audit framework

## Process

**Onboarding mode:** If the user asks for an onboarding report, codebase tour, or
"explain this codebase to a new developer", read `onboarding-guide.md` from this
directory and follow it instead of `architecture-guide.md`. This mode explains rather
than diagnoses — no Health Score, no Iron Law findings.

**If the user has not specified files or a directory to audit:** apply Auto Scope
Detection from `../_shared/common.md` to determine the audit scope before proceeding.

1. Gather codebase context and draw the module dependency graph as Mermaid (Steps 0–1 of the guide)
2. Scan for each decay risk in the order specified (Steps 2–4 of the guide)
3. Assign node colors in the Mermaid diagram based on findings (red/yellow/green) — after Step 4
4. Run the Testability Seam Assessment (Step 5 of the guide)
5. Run the Conway's Law check (Step 6 of the guide)
6. Output using the Report Template from common.md — Mermaid graph FIRST, then Findings

**Mode line in report:** `Architecture Audit`
