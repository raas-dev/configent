# agent prefs

## speak
- spartan. terse.
- pragmatic. structured.
- sections + lists.

## plan
- first principles
- conflict → Ask. else ship.
- no "shall I proceed?"

## build
- todo for 1+ task
- write tests
- no comment soup

## verify
- test e2e before "done"
- no fake complete
- no PR/push/publish w/o ask

## answer
- summary at end
- uncertain → limits + fix path
- risks → propose fix

## Codebase Memory

## Codebase Knowledge Graph (codebase-memory-mcp)

This project uses codebase-memory-mcp to maintain a knowledge graph of the codebase.
ALWAYS prefer MCP graph tools over grep/glob/file-search for code discovery.

### Priority Order
1. `search_graph` — find functions, classes, routes, variables by pattern
2. `trace_path` — trace who calls a function or what it calls
3. `get_code_snippet` — read specific function/class source code
4. `check_index_coverage` — validate candidate paths and missed ranges before claims
5. `query_graph` — run Cypher queries for complex patterns
6. `get_architecture` — high-level project summary

### Evidence tiers
- **Scout (Tier 1):** quick positive lookup with few calls and targeted source checks. Mark it provisional; do not make negative or exhaustive claims.
- **Verify (Tier 2, default):** task-directed graph evidence, relevant trace directions, exact snippets for material claims, and relevant pagination.
- **Auditor (Tier 3):** bounded-scope full verification with current generation, complete relevant pagination, both call directions and broader relationships when material, and every limitation disclosed.
- After candidate paths are known in any tier, call `check_index_coverage` once with every evidence path. Add relevant scopes for negative or exhaustive claims. A clean result means no recorded gap, not proof of completeness. For partial, skipped, excluded, stale, pending, or unknown coverage, read/grep the reported ranges or scope before relying on graph results.

### When to fall back to grep/glob
- Searching for string literals, error messages, config values
- Searching non-code files (Dockerfiles, shell scripts, configs)
- When MCP tools return insufficient results

### Examples
- Find a handler: `search_graph(name_pattern=".*OrderHandler.*")`
- Who calls it: `trace_path(function_name="OrderHandler", direction="inbound")`
- Read source: `get_code_snippet(qualified_name="pkg/orders.OrderHandler")`

### Session resets and subagents
- At session start or after compaction, confirm the nearest graph project and generation with `list_projects` or `index_status`, then choose Scout, Verify, or Auditor.
- Before spawning a subagent, query the graph and coverage in the parent. Pass the tier, project, generation/freshness, bounded scope, queries and pagination state, qualified symbols, paths, call-chain findings, coverage evidence with ranges/reasons, source fallback already performed, and unresolved questions in the delegated task context.
- Do not assume subagents inherit MCP access or the parent conversation. If a child lacks MCP tools, it must not call or claim MCP access. It should use the supplied evidence and read/grep exact source, especially every reported missed-coverage range.
