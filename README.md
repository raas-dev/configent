# cüåÄnfigent

No startup pitches, I am an opinionated config manager and machine bootstrapper.

Principles:

- 95% feature parity between macOS and the most popular Linux distros
- Scripts over cmdline options - keep it simple, comment out unwanted parts
- There is actually one, and only one, way to do things - the most efficient
- If something switches context faster than `tmux` and `zsh`, we'll switch to it
- The fastest open source web browser, VSCode and killer terminal. That's it.

Features:

- Bootstrap macOS/APT/YUM/Alpine Linux with one command, only `curl` required
- One character shell aliases - the fastest are the commands one does not write
- In terminal, Rust and Go written utilities are always preferred due to speed
- Multiple language versions with `rustup`, `gvm`, `nvm` `pyenv` and `rbenv`
- Run `docker` and `nerdctl` from macOS, by lima VMs for dockerd and containerd

Things are happening per user, but `sudo` may be required for some OS features.

## üí£

This repo is cloned to `$HOME/configent` or pulled if already exists there:

    curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/raas-dev/configent/main/install.sh | sh

If git is not present, it is installed first by the Linux distro's package
manager or by Xcode cmdline tools on macOS.

### GUI apps

Homebrew Cask or Snaps are not installed by default, as server/VM is assumed.

Re-run `./bootstrap` in the repo (after `install.sh` finishes) to install them.

### Private installation

Fork this repository. Installing from a private git repo has some prerequisites:
- Install git to clone the repo (on macOS: `xcode-select --install`)
- Create an SSH key pair (`ssh-keygen -t rsa`)
- Add SSH key `.pub` part in GitHub

Then run the one command install/update:

    git clone git@github.com:raas-dev/configent.git && configent/install.sh

## üîã's included

Script `bootstrap` runs the three scripts in the order documented below.

### ‚öôÔ∏è symlink_dotfiles

Symlinks all the files in `dotfiles/` to the user's home directory.

Script `bootstrap` passes `-f` to this script to skip override prompts per file.

Directory `bin` is symlinked to `~/local/bin`, taking 1st preference in `PATH`.

If `~/local/bin` already exists, it is backed up as `~/local/bin-old`.

Restart the shell or run `source ~/.zshrc`. Then you may simply reload with `r`.

All the binaries in `bin/` are available by name from now on.

### üñ•Ô∏è install_apps

MacOS, APT-distros (Ubuntu, Debian), YUM-distros (Fedora, Rocky) and
Alpine Linux are supported.

**On ARM64 Linux distros, Homebrew is skipped (see Known bugs).**

Order of installation:
1. [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) if it is not already in `PATH`
2. [Homebrew Cask](https://formulae.brew.sh/cask/) and casks (macOS) or
[Snap](https://snapcraft.io/) (Linux distros) and snaps
3. [Terminess](https://www.programmingfonts.org/#terminus) monospace font
4. Vim bundles, and if `brew` is present, Neovim 
5. Rust, Go, Node, Python and Ruby version managers and the language versions
6. Zsh, tmux, command-line utilities and infrastructure-as-code tools

### üñäÔ∏è setup_vscode

The script symlinks `vscode/` to `<os_vscode_path>/Code`.

This is done even if `code` is not (yet) installed.

The old `Code/` is first backed up as `Code-old`.

If `code` is present, VSCode extensions are installed.

## üêö User's default shell

Set the brew installed `zsh` as the user's default shell:

    install_zsh

If prefer `bash` instead, install the latest from brew and set it as default:

    install_bash

## üèóÔ∏è Docker and containerd

On macOS, these shims wrap the respective commands to run inside Lima VMs:

- `docker`: Runs docker cli and prefers rootless docker (no sudo required)
- `docker-compose`: Installs and runs docker-compose as a docker cli plugin
- `nerdctl`: Runs nerdctl (incl. nerdctl compose) in containerd user context

The shims are available in non-interactive sessions, while `~/.aliases` is
sourced only in terminals where STDIN (effectively keyboard) is present.

The shims create or start the necessary virtual machines, a lima VM named
'ubuntu' for running rootless Docker and a lima VM 'rancher' for containerd.

In addition, the 'rancher' VM has [k3s](https://k3s.io/) for local Kubernetes development.

See aliases to create additional VMs and named aliases `d` and `n` for
container build and run shortcuts.

## üî® Development

Tested on:
- macOS Catalina (10.15), Big Sur (11) and Monterey (12)
- Ubuntu Linux 21.10 (Impish Indri)
- Debian Linux 11 (bullseye)
- Fedora Linux 35
- Rocky Linux 8.5
- Alpine Linux 3.14.3

### Known bugs

Tracked in [GitHub issue tracker](https://github.com/raas-dev/configent/issues).

#### Won't fix

- Homebrew on Linux is not officially supported on aarch64
    - Hack1: Installer can be patched to skip the aarch64 check
    - Hack2: Requirement ruby 2.6.8 can be installed system-wide from source
    - Showstopper: Most formulas do not have aarch64 bottle
        - Building all dependencies from source would be tedious task
- Rocky Linux 8.5 has serious issues booting on aarch64
    - Rootless Docker installer (sh) does not work on x86_64 either
- [On Alpine Linux, nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm/blob/master/README.md#installing-nvm-on-alpine-linux) can install Node.js only from source
    - `nvm install --lts -s` does this but takes an hour
    - Alternatively, `sudo apk add nodejs npm` if Node version does not matter
- On Alpine Linux, [gvm](https://github.com/stefanmaric/g) does not work
    - Pre-compiled binaries do not exist, as Alpine bases on musl and not glibc
    - Use `sudo apk add go` instead to install go
- Podman does not seem very well with most containers (as of 2021-12)
