# cüåÄnfigent (1.50.0)

[![Changelog](https://img.shields.io/github/v/tag/raas-dev/configent?label=changelog&sort=semver)](https://github.com/raas-dev/configent/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md)
[![LGPL-3.0](https://img.shields.io/github/license/raas-dev/configent)](https://github.com/raas-dev/configent/blob/main/LICENSE)

No startup pitches, I am a DevOps principled development machine bootstrapper.

- 100% automated: Scripts over options or menus, comment out unwanted parts
- 95% consistent user experience both on macOS and the most used Linux distros
- There is actually one, and only one, way to do it right - the most efficient
- If something switches context faster than `tmux` and `zsh`, we'll switch to it
- The secure open source web browser, VSCode and a killer terminal. That's it.

| --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |

Features:

- Get full macOS or Linux development environment by running one `curl` command
- macOS `docker` experience exactly as it was with Docker Desktop, but it's free
- Multiplexed terminals with helpers/utilities written in Rust and Go for speed
- One character shell aliases - the fastest are the commands one does not type
- Use GPT in terminal and in IDE to create rest of the commands, code and apps

Works on:

- macOS Ventura (13), Monterey (12) and Big Sur (11) on Intel and ARM Macs
- Ubuntu Linux 22.04 LTS (Jammy Jellyfish)
- Debian Linux 12 (bookworm) and 11 (bullseye)
- Fedora Linux 38, 37 and 36
- Rocky Linux 9 and 8
- CentOS Stream 9 and 8
- AlmaLinux 9 and 8
- Oracle Linux 9 and 8
- Arch Linux (rolling; since 2022-07)
- Alpine Linux 3.18, 3.17, 3.16 and 3.15

Minimum requirements are 4GB RAM and 10GB disk, or a 2016 MacBook Pro,
both on which it is <30 minutes.

## üí£ Up

VSCode configs and dotfiles are installed per-user.
**Existing dotfiles at `$HOME` are overridden without prompting.**

    curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/raas-dev/configent/1.50.0/install.sh | sh

To install system-wide packages, `sudo` password may be asked in the beginning.

If git is not present, it is installed by the Linux distro's package manager
or by Xcode Command Line Tools on macOS.

Then the respective git tag from this repository is cloned as `$HOME/configent`,
or main branch is pulled on top of it if the git working copy already exists.

### Server (default)

Script `install.sh` is non-interactive and suitable for cloud-init when run as
user with passwordless sudo (recommended), or as root.

Fork this repo, comment or uncomment the wanted tech stacks in `install_apps`,
and change the curl URL to point to your public fork.

GUI apps are not installed by `install.sh` as a server is assumed.

### Desktop

Run `bootstrap` in the git working copy (`$HOME/configent`) to install GUI apps.

Add or remove GUI apps to your liking in `bin/install_apps_snap`
(Snap on Linux distros) or `bin/install_apps_cask` (Homebrew Cask on macOS).

To use GUI apps on Linux distros, you have to install Xorg, display manager and
window manager of your choice. See the distro's own instructions for that.

## üîã's included

Script `bootstrap` runs the three below scripts in the order described.

This script essentially handles the whole automated setup (dotfiles, apps,
VSCode, zsh) of the machine it is run in and the script is non-interactive.

The default shell is not changed to zsh (as there is a chance that zsh
installation has failed), but you may do it (and get prompted) by running
`bin/install_zsh` after `bootstrap` has finished.

### symlink_dotfiles

Creates symlinks in the user's home directory for all the files in  `dotfiles/`.

Script `bootstrap` passes `-f` to `symlink_dotfiles` to skip override prompts
per already existing file or symlink in the user's home directory.

Directory `bin` is symlinked to `~/local/bin`, taking 1st preference in `PATH`.
If `~/local/bin` already exists, it is backed up as `~/local/bin-old`.

üí°: Restart the shell or run `source ~/.bashrc`. Then on, you may simply reload
the configuration of the current shell (`.bashrc` or `.zshrc`) shell with `r`
and all the scripts in `bin/` are available by name.

### install_apps

MacOS, APT, YUM and pacman based distros, as well as Alpine Linux, are known.

‚ö†Ô∏è: On AArch64 Linux distros, Homebrew parts are skipped (see [Issues in dependencies](https://github.com/raas-dev/configent#issues-in-dependencies)).

Order of installation:
1. [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) if it is not already in `PATH`
2. [Homebrew Cask](https://formulae.brew.sh/cask/) and casks (macOS) or
[Snap](https://snapcraft.io/) (Linux distros) and snaps
3. Zsh, tmux, tmux plugins, cloud development and infrastructure-as-code tools
4. Rust, Go, Node.js and Python version managers, language versions and packages
5. [Terminess](https://www.programmingfonts.org/#terminus) monospace font
6. Vim bundles, and if `brew` is present, [Neovim](https://neovim.io/)

With Homebrew on Linux, system-wide installation (i.e. `/home/linuxbrew`) is
preferred, but if this is not possible (no `sudo`), it is installed user's home.

On macOS, Homebrew, formulae and casks are always installed user-wide.

On Linux distros, snaps are system-wide and auto-upgraded on schedule by snapd.

### setup_vscode

The script symlinks `vscode/` to `<user_vscode_path>/Code`.
The old `Code/` is first backed up as `Code-old`.

Symlinking happens even if `code` has not been installed.
If `code` is present, also VSCode extensions are installed.

Configuring
[VSCode Settings Sync](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/settings-sync)
will not interfere with storing configs in the git repo.

## üêö Default shell

Set the brew installed `zsh` as the user's default shell:

    install_zsh

If you prefer `bash` instead, brew the latest Bash and set it as default:

    install_bash

## üèóÔ∏è dockerd and containerd

Both container runtimes in a nutshell:

- the two are different runtimes - if you used Docker Desktop, it was dockerd
- containerd is the industry-standard runtime in Kubernetes deployments
- regardless of the runtime, containers must not be run with `sudo`

These `bin/` shims wrap the container runtime CLIs to run best-effort on the OS:

- `docker`: Runs docker cli and prefers rootless dockerd (no sudo is required)
- `docker-compose`: Runs classic docker-compose as a docker cli plugin
- `nerdctl`: Runs nerdctl (also `nerdctl compose`) in user context containerd

The shims are available in non-interactive sessions, while `~/.aliases` is
sourced only in terminals where STDIN (effectively keyboard) is present.

üí°: Use alias `d` as a generic shortcut for starting a `docker` container
when the current working directory has `Dockerfile` present. After container
has been started, the host-container mapped ports are output.

üí°: Use alias `n` for running containers for binaries you prefer not to install,
by building ad-hoc images with [Nixery](https://nixery.dev/).

### macOS

Both dockerd and containerd base on Linux kernel features not present on macOS
so [Lima](https://github.com/lima-vm/lima) is used creating Linux VMs on QEMU.

The above shims create or start the necessary virtual machines, a lima VM named
'ubuntu' for running rootless dockerd and a lima VM 'rancher' for containerd.

‚ö†Ô∏è: Both 'ubuntu' and 'rancher' VMs mount your host's `$HOME` directory as
writable in the VM. This enables containers to use bind mounts (directories
on file system). If you want to keep host's home read-only (and prefer container
managed volumes instead), adjust `writable` in `etc/lima/<vmname>.yaml`.

In addition, VM 'rancher' includes [k3s](https://k3s.io/) for local Kubernetes.

## üî® Development

See `dotfiles/.aliases` for `vm4...` creating
[lima](https://github.com/lima-vm/lima) VMs to test on various Linux distros.

üí°: See alias `v` for starting, shelling into, stopping and deleting the VM.

VMs are provisioned by [cloud-init](https://cloudinit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
on boot by fetching and running `install.sh` from this repo's main branch.

Once VM has been started, your host's `$HOME` directory is mounted in the VM,
for testing script changes without first committing and pushing to your fork.

### Issues in dependencies

- Homebrew on Linux on AArch64: [Not officially supported](https://docs.brew.sh/Homebrew-on-Linux#arm-unsupported)
    - Most formulae do not have AArch64 binary packages ("bottles") for Linux
    - Building all dependencies from source would be too long of a bootstrap
    - Thus `install.sh` skips Homebrew parts on AArch64 Linux distros (2022-07)
- Fedora Linux: Must reboot after `squashfuse` installation for `snap` to work
    - error: `system does not fully support snapd: cannot mount squashfs image using "squashfs"`
- Arch Linux on AArch64
  - If `pacman` fails, backup and replace `/etc/pacman.d/mirrorlist` e.g. with:
    - `Server = http://eu.mirror.archlinuxarm.org/$arch/$repo`
- Alpine Linux on Lima: Lima [shims](https://github.com/lima-vm/lima/blob/master/pkg/cidata/cidata.TEMPLATE.d/boot/01-alpine-ash-as-bash.sh) `/bin/bash` to `/bin/ash` on boot
    - Thus Installing bash and setting it as the user's login shell does not work expectedly
- Homebrew on Alpine Linux: Issues in formulae due to Alpine Linux not using glibc
