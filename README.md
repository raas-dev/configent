# cüåÄnfigent (1.129.0)

[![Changelog](https://img.shields.io/github/v/tag/raas-dev/configent?label=changelog&sort=semver)](https://github.com/raas-dev/configent/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md)
[![LGPL-3.0](https://img.shields.io/github/license/raas-dev/configent)](https://github.com/raas-dev/configent/blob/main/LICENSE)

No startup pitches, I am a DevOps principled environment bootstrapper.

- Work must finish by running one command. Mouse is not productivity.
- Does not install 10s of tools most of which can be run ad-hoc in a container.
- 95% consistent user experience both on macOS and the beloved Linux distros.
- There is only one way to manage programming languages and tool versions.
- AI agents are built on prompt chaining and function calling to self-direct.

| --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |

A few features:

- One character `.aliases`: The fastest are the commands one does not type.
- Apps are Rust, Go and C for speed, and `n`ix-shells are for ad-hoc binaries.
- macOS `docker` experience like it was with Docker Desktop but without cost.
- Run `up` to upgrade every package manager but respect locked tool versions.
- Ask AI (`a <question>`), open chat on (`ai <topic>`) or ask assistant (`_`).

Works on x86-64 and ARM:

- macOS Sequoia (15), Sonoma (14) and Ventura (13)
- Ubuntu Linux 24.04 LTS (Noble Numbat) and 22.04 LTS (Jammy Jellyfish)
- Debian Linux 12 (Bookworm) and 11 (Bullseye)
- Fedora Linux 38, 37 and 36
- CentOS Stream 9 and 8
- AlmaLinux 9 and 8
- Rocky Linux 9 and 8
- Oracle Linux 9 and 8
- openSUSE Leap 15.4
- Arch Linux (rolling; since 2022-07)
- Alpine Linux 3.19, 3.18 and 3.17

Minimum requirements are 4GB RAM and 12GB disk, on which it takes <30 minutes.

## ü•æ Up

Already existing **dotfiles are overridden without prompting**. There is no
uninstaller currently.

If in doubt, test drive in a virtual machine.

Installer requires only `curl` available:

    curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/raas-dev/configent/1.129.0/install.sh | sh

Things are installed primarily per-user, but to install system-wide requirements
(such as `git`), `sudo` password may be asked in the beginning.

The respective git tag from this repository is cloned in `~/configent`,
or main branch is pulled on top of the git working copy if it already exists.

User's configs (dotfiles, symlinks and directories) overridden are backed up in
`~/configent/.backup` with same directory hierarchy as they located in `$HOME`.

### Server (default)

Script `install.sh` is non-interactive and suitable for cloud-init when run as
user with passwordless sudo.

**The defaults are what is most often used in software development in cloud.**
If you want to deviate from it, the fastest is to fork this repository,
make changes and cURL your public fork.

GUI apps are not installed by `install.sh` as a server is assumed, unless you
explicitly pass `FLATPAKS=true` (Linux distros) or `CASKS=true` (macOS) to the
script.

### Desktop

Alternatively, you can run `bootstrap` in the git working copy (`~/configent`)
to install GUI apps.

Add or remove GUI apps to your liking in `bin/install_apps_flatpak`
(Flatpak on Linux distros) or `bin/install_apps_cask` (Homebrew Cask on macOS).

To use GUI apps on Linux distros, you have to install Xorg, display manager and
window manager of your choice. See your distro's own instructions for that.

## üîã's included

Script `bootstrap` essentially handles the whole automated setup (dotfiles,
apps, editor) of the machine it is run in. These three respective scripts are
described further below.

Necessities (such as Zsh) are installed from the Linux distro's repo,
or from Homebrew if it is runnable on the OS and the CPU architecture.

The script is non-interactive: Due to this, and though Zsh is preferred, it is
not set as the user's default shell. You may do it and get prompted, possibly
asked `sudo`, by running `bin/install_zsh` after `bootstrap` has finished.

### symlink_dotfiles

Symlinks are created in in the user's home directory for all the files in
`dotfiles/`. Files or symlinks of the same name at `$HOME` are overridden.

In addition the tool specific configurations in `etc/` are symlinked in
`~/.config` either as config files or directories depending on the tool.

Directory `bin` in this repository is symlinked to `~/.local/configent/bin`,
taking 1st preference in `PATH`. Directory `etc` in this repository is
symlinked to `~/.config/configent`.

Restart the shell or run `source ~/.bashrc`. Then on, you may simply reload
the configuration of the current shell (`.bashrc` or `.zshrc`) with `r` and all
the scripts in `bin/` are available by name from now on.

üí°: Export your own environment variables in `~/.rclocal`. Git name and email
are automatically exported here if they were set in your previous `.gitconfig`.

### install_apps

Sensible defaults are used. Enable or disable tools in `etc/mise/config.toml`.

What's installed by default:
1. Zsh, antidote (plugin manager for Zsh) and Zsh plugins
2. Other command-line essentials and a few build time requirements
3. Vim, Vundle (plugin manager for Vim) and Vim bundles (Vim plugins)
4. GUI apps by [Homebrew Cask](https://formulae.brew.sh/cask/) (macOS) or
[Flatpak](https://flatpak.org/) (Linux distros)
5. Rust, Go, Node.js, Python and .NET language runtimes and a few packages
6. Linters (static analysis tools) and AWS and Azure development tools
7. Neovim with [LazyVim](https://www.lazyvim.org/)
8. Tmux, tpm (Tmux Plugin Manager) and tmux plugins
9. [Ollama](https://ollama.com/) and it is (auto-)started on background
10. [Terminess](https://www.nerdfonts.com/font-downloads) monospace font

Apt, yum (dnf), zypper, pacman and apk package managers are recognized and used
to install requirements from Linux distro's repository (requires `sudo` rights).
Flatpaks (GUI apps) are always installed user-wide.

On macOS, [Homebrew](https://brew.sh) is used to install requirements and
casks (GUI apps) user-wide.

Language runtimes and development tools are always installed user-wide by
[mise](https://mise.jdx.dev/). Global versions are defined in
`~/.config/mise/config.toml`. Whenever possible,
[mise plugins](https://mise.jdx.dev/registry.html) are preferred over Homebrew.

‚ö†Ô∏è: Homebrew may or may not be present after installation, as Homebrew Linux
[does not work on ARM](https://docs.brew.sh/Homebrew-on-Linux#arm-unsupported).

With Homebrew on Linux (x86-64), system-wide installation (`/home/linuxbrew`) is
preferred, but if it this not possible (no `sudo`), it is installed user's home.
Zsh is installed using Homebrew, even on Linux, as it likely has newer version
than the one installed from the distro's repo. Script `install_bash` works
similarly, on you choose to install newer Bash manually.

üí°: See [mise documentation](https://mise.jdx.dev/configuration.html) for
configuring project specific versions.

### setup_code

[VSCodium](https://vscodium.com/) is the default editor on Linux distros and
[VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) is the default on macOS.

The script symlinks `vscode/` to `<editor_specific_path>/User`.
Existing `User` directory is first backed up to
`~/configent/.backup/<editor_specific_path>/User`.

‚ö†Ô∏è: This does not install any editor, see OS specific install scripts for that.

If editor command-line binary is present, the extensions
(`vscode/extensions.list`) are installed.

## üß¨ IDE extensions

To update `vscode/extensions.list` after adding or removing extensions
in VS Code like editor, run `vscode/create_extensions_list`.

üí°: You can reuse both `setup_code` and `vscode/create_extensions_list` scripts
for VS Code like editor such as Cursor or Windsurf. See the scripts' arguments.

Some extensions may be unavailable for VSCodium and VS Code forks.
Extensions in [Open VSX Registry](https://open-vsx.org/) are available
for all VS Code like editors and are thus preferred.

By default, the editor extensions do not use any additional configuration
outside what is in `vscode/*.json`. Exceptions are documented below.

### bin/setup_continue

[Continue](https://docs.continue.dev) is installed for chat and code
completion by Large Language Models in VS Code like editors.
Note that (commercial) VS Code forks may prefer their own closed source
solutions and disable the extension automatically.

The `bin/setup_continue` copies the Continue configuration files and
installs Node.js packages (like dotenv) used by the configuration.
The script is in `PATH` and **is already run in bootstrap** after it has
installed editor extensions.

Some manual configuration is required:

1. You must export LLM Providers' API key environment variables used by
`~/.continue/config.ts` in e.g. `~/.rclocal` (outside the git repo).

2. If you are using local LLMs via Ollama (for code autocompletion), you must
`ollama pull` those models before they are automatically started by Continue.

3. ‚ö†Ô∏è: File `config.ts` (unlike `.json`) is copied in place, not symlinked -
you must manually run `setup_continue` if/after editing the `.ts` file.

## üêö Default shell

Set `zsh` as the user's default shell:

    install_zsh

If you prefer `bash` instead:

    install_bash

These scripts are interactive as they prompt to change the default shell,
(unless that is default already). Such change may also require `sudo`
password to be entered, so if `NONINTERACTIVE=true` is passed (such as
`bootstrap` does), the default shell won't be changed. The shell plugins,
if any, are installed even in that case.

## üèóÔ∏è Containers

Supported container runtimes:

- the original OCI compatible runtime was Docker (used by Docker Desktop)
- containerd is the industry-standard (CNCF) runtime in Kubernetes deployments
- third option is Podman, which is nearly Docker compatible daemonless runtime

These `bin/` shims wrap the container CLIs to use those runtimes:

- `docker`: Runs Docker CLI, installing build and compose CLI plugins when used
- `nerdctl`: Runs nerdctl (on containerd), which has build and compose built-in
- `podman`: Runs Podman CLI (on daemonless Podman), but lacks proper compose

See [rootless containers](https://rootlesscontaine.rs/) as those are preferred.

### macOS

Container runtimes base on Linux kernel features not present on macOS. Thus
[Lima](https://github.com/lima-vm/lima) is used for creating Linux VMs.

The aforementioned shims create and start the necessary virtual machines:
Ubuntu for Docker, Debian for containerd and Fedora for Podman.

In addition, VM 'debian' has [k3s](https://k3s.io/) for testing on Kubernetes.
See VM's startup message for exporting `KUBECONFIG` to use it with `kubectl`.

The following host directories are mounted read-write for VMs:

- `$HOME/dev`
- `$HOME/Downloads`
- `/tmp/lima`

### docker shortcut

Alias `d` is a shortcut for building Docker image in the current directory.
`Dockerfile` is read if present, otherwise [nixpacks](https://nixpacks.com/)
is used to detect the tech stack and build the image best-effort.

‚ö†Ô∏è: Ensure the Docker image you are building `FROM` is safe before proceeding.

After the image is built, a new container is launched from it. If `.env` file
is present in the current directory, its environment variables are set in the
container.

If you use `PORT=8000 d`, the port given is mapped to the host and environment
variable `PORT` is set inside the container. Note that this takes precedence
if `PORT` is also defined in `.env` file.

If `d -d` or `d --detached` is used, all arguments are passed to `docker run`.
CMD defined in `Dockerfile` is effective. ENTRYPOINT defined in `Dockerfile`
(or by `nixpacks`) is effective, unless you override it in arguments.

If container was started as detached and successfully started up, docker logs
are followed. Sending `^C` exits the log view and does not stop the container.

If `-d` or `--detached` is not used, an interactive session is assumed and all arguments are passed to `docker run` entrypoint `/bin/sh -c` as commands, e.g.
`d bash` starts Bash in the container. Exiting the shell stops the container.

‚ö†Ô∏è: If container writes to filesystem, you must be in a VM writable directory.

## ‚ùÑÔ∏è Nix

[Nix](https://nix.dev/) is not installed on the host, but alias `nixd` starts
a container where `nix`, `nix-env`, `nix-shell`, etc. are available.
The container image is built by `etc/nix/Containerfile`.

The environment is created in the current directory and alias `n` is used e.g.
`n vim README.md` to run Vim in an isolated `nix-shell` on containerd.

Package name(s, separated by forward slashes) are taken as the first argument.
The packages are installed from channel
[unstable](https://search.nixos.org/packages?channel=unstable).

The binary is assumed named according to the first package. The rest of the
arguments are passed to the binary. If binary name is different from the
package name, put meta-package "shell" first, e.g. `n shell/postgresql psql`.

You can expose `PORT` on the host, e.g. `PORT=8000 n python3 -m http.server`.

‚ö†Ô∏è: If binary writes to filesystem, you must be in a VM writable directory.

üí°: Use `n` for command-line tools not wanted permanently installed on the
host. See `.aliases` for example ad-hoc tools such as container image scanners.

## üî® VMs

See `dotfiles/.aliases` for `vm4...` creating
[Lima](https://github.com/lima-vm/lima) VMs to test on various Linux distros.

üí°: See alias `v` for starting, shelling into, stopping and deleting a VM.

VMs are provisioned by [cloud-init](https://cloudinit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
on boot by pulling and running `install.sh` from this repository's main branch.

‚ö†Ô∏è: Regardless of pulling main, the version to install is defined in
`install.sh` and is only updated by `release.sh`.

You may willingly live on the edge by explicitly passing `GIT_REF`:

    curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/raas-dev/configent/main/install.sh | GIT_REF=main sh

For development purposes, once the VM has been started, host's `$HOME/configent`
is mounted read-only in the VM. This enables testing most changes without first
committing and pushing to your fork.
